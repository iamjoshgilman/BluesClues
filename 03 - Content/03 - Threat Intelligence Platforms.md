# Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)

![[Pasted image 20230619110823.png]]

Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIPs) are powerful tools used to manage and analyze large volumes of cyber threat intelligence. They serve as a centralized repository for various types of intelligence, including actors, campaigns, signatures, bulletins, and Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). TIPs offer several key functionalities for security teams:

1. **Aggregation and Normalization:** TIPs collect and consolidate intelligence from multiple sources, ensuring that information is organized and standardized for analysis.

2. **Integration with Security Controls:** TIPs can integrate with existing security controls such as firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and endpoint protection tools, enabling the dissemination of threat intelligence to these systems for improved defense.

3. **Analysis and Sharing:** TIPs facilitate the analysis of threat intelligence by providing tools and features for correlation, enrichment, scoring, and collaboration among security teams.

## Why Use a TIP?

Implementing a Threat Intelligence Platform offers several benefits for organizations across different teams:

1. **Security Operations Center (SOC) Teams:** TIPs automate routine activities and provide integrations, enrichment, and scoring capabilities, streamlining operational tasks and improving response efficiency.

2. **Threat Intelligence Teams:** TIPs serve as a "library" of information, allowing threat intelligence teams to make predictions based on associations and contextual information between actors, campaigns, and more.

3. **Management and Executive Teams:** TIPs provide a single platform for management to view technical and high-level reports, enabling effective data sharing, analysis, and incident response.

## Data Aggregation

A Threat Intelligence Platform automatically collects and reconciles data from various sources and formats. Ingesting information from a variety of sources is a critical component of a strong security infrastructure. Supported sources and formats include:

**Sources:**
- Open-source
- 3rd party paid
- Government
- Trusted Sharing Communities (ISACs)
- Internal

**Formats:**
- STIX/TAXII
- JSON and XML
- Email
- .csv, .txt, PDF, Word document

## TIP Products

There are several Threat Intelligence Platform products available in the industry. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP):** An open-source project with extensive functionality used by over 6000 organizations worldwide. MISP offers features for intelligence sharing and automated defenses.

2. **ThreatConnect:** A comprehensive Threat Intelligence Platform that automates intelligence collection from various sources, regardless of the format. It includes automation through runbooks for tailored response actions.

3. **Anomali:** Anomali's TIP is utilized by Information Sharing and Analysis Centers, such as FS-ISAC, and offers the ability to create custom ISACs for intelligence sharing. Anomali provides an "app store" for integrations and threat feeds to enhance the capabilities of the TIP and other security controls.

4. **ThreatQ:** A threat-centric platform that prioritizes based on threat and risk, facilitates collaboration across teams, automates workflows, and integrates multiple security products into a unified infrastructure. It extends beyond typical TIP capabilities and assists with vulnerability management, spear phishing, incident response, and threat hunting.
