# [[03 - Preparation - Asset inventory and Risk Assessments]]  
---

- Keeping an up-to-date asset inventory and conducting risk assessments are essential components of incident response preparation.
- An asset inventory helps monitor and protect systems within the organization, while risk assessments prioritize resources based on the criticality of assets.

## Asset Inventory
- An asset inventory is a centralized and updated list of all IT assets within the organization.
- Typical assets included in an inventory:
  - Desktops/Laptops
  - Servers
  - Printers
  - Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices (e.g., heaters, TVs, alarms, vending machines)
  - Network devices (firewalls, switches, routers, load balancers)
  - Mobile devices (phones, tablets)

- The purpose of an asset inventory:
  - Store key information associated with each device, such as system owner, operating system version, installed software, and assigned IP addresses.
  - Aid in asset management, system updates, and technical support.

- Benefits of an asset inventory for security teams:
  - Identify outdated operating systems by reviewing OS version details.
  - Connect affected internal IP addresses to system owners or contacts during security incidents.
  - Determine the purpose and sensitivity of suspicious systems by referencing the asset inventory.

## Risk Assessments
- Risk assessments identify critical systems and prioritize their protection based on their value to the business.
- Prioritization is crucial when multiple incidents occur simultaneously.

- Steps in conducting risk assessments:
  1. Identify risks, such as internet-facing systems, unpatched systems, or business-critical systems.
  2. Implement appropriate security measures commensurate with the level of risk.
  3. Four approaches to risk:
     - Transfer the risk (e.g., purchasing insurance)
     - Accept the risk (low impact and high cost make resource allocation impractical)
     - Mitigate the risk (apply security controls to reduce risk)
     - Avoid the risk (take an asset offline if the risk is too high)

- Conducting cybersecurity risk assessments:
  - IT Governance UK website provides resources on conducting cybersecurity risk assessments.

## Conclusion
- Asset inventory and risk assessments are critical components of incident response preparation.
- An asset inventory helps identify and manage systems, aiding incident response and technical support.
- Risk assessments prioritize resource allocation based on the criticality of assets, ensuring effective incident response in a multi-incident scenario.
- Understanding risk enables appropriate resource allocation, whether through risk transfer, acceptance, mitigation, or avoidance.
