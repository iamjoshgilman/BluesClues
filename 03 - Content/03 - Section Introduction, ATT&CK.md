# [[03 - Section Introduction, ATT&CK]]  
---

- The MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ framework is a comprehensive collection of tactics and techniques used by adversaries in cyber operations.
- It can be utilized by both blue team (defenders) and red team (offensive) members to improve the security posture of an organization.

### Defensive Roles

- Defenders can use the ATT&CK framework to assess their visibility and detection capabilities.
- Identify areas where they have good visibility and areas that require improvement.
- Improve visibility and detection capabilities by writing rules or alerts that trigger on suspicious or malicious activity.
- Utilize tools like ATT&CK Navigator for better visibility and analysis.
- Threat hunters can proactively hunt for malicious activity by leveraging the tactics and techniques outlined in the framework.
- Hunt for covert or unknown threats and take necessary actions to discover and stop them.

### Offensive Roles

- Adversary emulation involves performing penetration tests or red team exercises while copying the tactics and techniques of a known threat actor.
- Red team mimics the behavior of a specific threat actor likely to target the organization.
- For example, if the organization is a telecommunications company, the offensive team may emulate APT 19's techniques, as they have targeted similar industry organizations before.
- Adversary emulation allows the blue team to test their detection capabilities and identify any blind spots.
- The red team reports on identified blind spots so they can be addressed by the blue team.

## 12 Stages in the ATT&CK Framework

1. **Initial Access**: Techniques used by adversaries to gain initial access to a target system or network.
2. **Execution**: Techniques used to execute malicious code or commands on a target system.
3. **Persistence**: Methods employed by adversaries to maintain their presence on a compromised system.
4. **Privilege Escalation**: Techniques used to gain higher privileges or access levels on a compromised system.
5. **Defense Evasion**: Measures taken by adversaries to avoid detection or hinder defensive mechanisms.
6. **Credential Access**: Methods employed to obtain valid credentials for unauthorized access.
7. **Discovery**: Techniques used to gather information about the target environment, such as network and system reconnaissance.
8. **Lateral Movement**: Actions taken by adversaries to move through a network, compromising additional systems.
9. **Collection**: Techniques used to gather data or information from compromised systems.
10. **Exfiltration**: Methods employed by adversaries to remove or transfer data from a compromised system or network.
11. **Command and Control**: Techniques used to establish and maintain communication channels between adversaries and compromised systems.
12. **Impact**: Actions taken by adversaries to manipulate, disrupt, or destroy systems or data.
