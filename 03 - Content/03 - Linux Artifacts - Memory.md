While this applies to both Windows and Linux-based operating systems, capturing the system's memory can provide a goldmine of information, such as processes that are running, their relationships with other processes, established network connections, and much more.

We can use various tools to create a memory dump, a file containing the contents of the system's memory at the time of acquisition, such as LiME ([https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME](https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME)) and memdump ([https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/memdump.1.html)](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/memdump.1.html)).
