# [[03 - Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain]]  
---

The **Cyber Kill Chain (CKC)** framework was developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011 as an Intelligence Driven Defense model. It serves as a methodology for identifying and preventing cyber attacks, specifically those categorized as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). The CKC helps IT security teams and professionals develop strategies, products, and plans to detect and contain attacks at different stages, leading to a more secure IT environment. Over the years, it has become a widely recognized standard for describing attack sequences within a network.

The CKC consists of seven stages that an attacker typically goes through to successfully execute a cyber attack:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Attackers gather information about the target organization using various methods such as domain record lookups, port scanning, vulnerability scanning, and social media profiling.

2. **Weaponization**: Attackers create their own backdoor or malicious file, often embedding it within a legitimate document, and host it on a domain they control.

3. **Delivery**: Attackers craft and deliver a spear-phishing email or other means to deliver the weaponized payload to the victim, usually exploiting human vulnerabilities.

4. **Exploitation**: Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges or access within the compromised system.

5. **Installation**: Attackers install a backdoor or malware onto the compromised system, establishing persistence and ensuring continuous access.

6. **Command and Control**: Attackers establish a communication channel between the compromised system and a remote server under their control, enabling them to send commands and receive instructions.

7. **Actions on Objectives**: Attackers achieve their objectives, which may involve exfiltrating data, escalating privileges, or causing further damage.

While the CKC provides valuable insights into attack stages, it has some limitations. It may not effectively address insider threats, and the initial reconnaissance and weaponization stages often occur outside the defender's network, making detection challenging. To address these limitations and provide a more comprehensive model, MITRE combined the CKC with its ATT&CK framework to develop the Unified Kill Chain (UKC). The UKC includes 18 unique attack phases, considering activities both inside and outside the network. It offers an enhanced approach to analyzing and defending against APT attacks.

While the Cyber Kill Chain remains an important framework, other models, such as the Unified Kill Chain, may be more suitable for certain scenarios. The choice of framework depends on the specific context and requirements of the organization.
