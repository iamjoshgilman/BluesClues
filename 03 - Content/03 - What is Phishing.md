## Phishing
- Phishing is the act of sending an email with malicious intent, to coerce recipients into disclosing information, downloading malicious files, or otherwise completing an action that they would not normally do, by exploiting a human using one or more social-engineering techniques.
	- In short, phishing is a type of email-based attack, where malicious actors are actually attacking humans instead of computer system.

## The Impact
- Throughout 2019, a staggering 90% of all data breaches were linked to phishing (Retruster, 2019), with theÂ **average financial cost of a data breach being $3.86m**Â (IBM, 2019)
- **Phishing attempts have grown 65% from 2018 to 2019**Â (Retruster, 2019) 
- RoughlyÂ **1.5m new phishing sites are created each month**Â (Webroot, 2019).
- Extremely advanced malware is sent inside emails, withÂ **up to 1 million Emotet trojan emails sent in a single day**Â (Proofpoint, 2019).
