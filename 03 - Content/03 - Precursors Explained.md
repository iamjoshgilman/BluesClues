# [[03 - Precursors Explained]]  
---

Precursors, also known as threat precursors, are elements in the incident identification and response process that help both attackers and security professionals determine the existence of flaws and vulnerabilities within a system. By identifying precursors, organizations can work proactively to prevent cyber attacks before they occur.

# Challenges with Precursors

Although precursors play a crucial role in the security landscape, they present some challenges, particularly in terms of identification. Most attacks do not have readily identifiable or detectable precursors from the organization's perspective. This lack of identifiable precursors affects the time it takes to detect an attack and poses a significant disadvantage. If organizations had knowledge of these elements, they would have the opportunity to alter their security posture and potentially prevent incidents.

## Types of Precursors

Attacks can manifest in various forms, and attackers can utilize multiple methods to compromise a system. Therefore, precursors can arise in diverse ways, and both attackers and security professionals can employ various tools to obtain them. Here are some examples of precursors:

### Port Scanning, Operating System and Application Fingerprinting

Port scanning and operating system/application fingerprinting are effective ways to gather information about a network. Tools such as Nmap, Netcat, or Nessus enable researchers and attackers to identify services and vulnerabilities present in a system. These activities provide valuable information, such as the running services, open ports, the installed operating system, and the applications and their versions.

Precursors associated with port scanning and fingerprinting include:
- Monitoring network connections and event logs from internet-facing systems.
- Monitoring logs from firewalls or web application firewalls (WAFs) with rules set to alert and log when one source IP attempts to connect on multiple ports over a short period.
- Monitoring logs from scanned systems.

### Social Engineering and Reconnaissance

Social engineering is an effective means of gathering extensive information about an organization. Through social skills and deception, both attackers and researchers can uncover vulnerabilities and critical information. Techniques like "dumpster diving" (searching through trash for items like USB drives, printed documents, or notebooks) and "eavesdropping" (listening to conversations between employees) can reveal valuable pieces of information that can be exploited by attackers.

Precursors associated with social engineering and reconnaissance include:
- Listening to employee reports of unusual or suspicious activity.
- Reviewing CCTV footage from inside and outside the office.
- Noticing non-employees going through the organization's bins (dumpster diving).
- Observing unknown individuals loitering outside the office or lobby areas.
- Noticing employees engaged with unknown individuals outside or near the office.
- Receiving calls from unknown, withheld, or spoofed phone numbers.
- Document or office equipment going missing.

### OSINT Sources and Bulletin Boards

Reviewing social media, blogs, forums, bulletin boards, security articles, reports, and other open-source intelligence (OSINT) data, both on the clear web and dark web, can provide valuable insights.

Precursors associated with OSINT sources and bulletin boards include:
- Receiving an email or online message from a threat group threatening or indicating an attack on the organization.
- Identifying publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) that affect systems or programs used by the organization.
- Monitoring underground forums for discussions about zero-day exploits or new malware being utilized in the wild.
- Staying informed about reports from government organizations or intelligence vendors that indicate an increase in vulnerability exploitation activity.

By identifying and monitoring these precursors, organizations can enhance their threat detection capabilities, proactively respond to potential threats, and strengthen their overall security posture.
