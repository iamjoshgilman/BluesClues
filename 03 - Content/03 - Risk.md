# 03 - Risk
- Risk is the possibility of a negative impact on practically anything
	- business
	- financial
	- security
- A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat. 
	- Vulnerabilities can be managed whereas a threat cannot. 
- Management of risk is done by applying controls to bring the risk to an acceptable level. 
- Risk can be at different levels in an organization, from a single piece of equipment to a whole department or division.

## Four Responses to Risk
- Avoid
- Transfer
- Mitigate
- Accept

## Risk Assessments
- conducted to identify and determine the impacts of risk, the likelihood and the consequences should a risk materialize. These can help organizations make informed decisions based on the outcome of the assessment. Some risk assessments are required by law and so risk assessments are carried out to comply with these laws and regulations.
	- For example, there is a risk of a corporate laptop being lost by an employee, the likelihood is the probability it will occur and the consequence/impact is equipment & data loss. A risk assessment highlights this and enables mitigation to be put in place to prevent the consequence from ever materializing.

## Conducting an Assessment
- There are various ways risk assessments are carried out, but the basic steps are below:
	- Identifying potential hazards
	- Identifying who might be harmed by those hazards
	- Evaluating risk (severity and likelihood) and establishing suitable precautions
	- Implementing controls and recording your findings
	- Review your assessment and re-assessing if necessary.
- Risk assessments should be dynamic to be effective, they should be periodically reviewed and updated. In the world of cybersecurity, things are always changing at a fast pace and so should a risk assessment change with the risks.

## Managing Risk
- Risk can be managed in four different ways depending on the organization's risk appetite or objectives.
