# [[03 - Chain of Custody]]

The **Chain of Custody** is a vital process in computer forensics, ensuring the integrity and security of evidence throughout a case. It involves documenting relevant information about the evidence, such as its acquisition, transfer, and handling, in order to prevent unauthorized tampering. Here are the key points to understand about the Chain of Custody:

## Importance of Chain of Custody

The Chain of Custody is crucial in digital forensics, especially for court cases. Without a clear and well-documented Chain of Custody, the court may dismiss the evidence due to concerns of unauthorized alteration. The Chain of Custody provides insight into the evidence's history, including who handled it, when, how, and with what equipment. Its importance lies in:

1. **Evidence Acceptance:** A well-maintained Chain of Custody increases the chances of evidence being accepted in court, supporting the integrity of the investigation.
2. **Integrity Assurance:** By tracking and logging the evidence from acquisition to presentation, the Chain of Custody safeguards its integrity and security.

## Following the Chain of Custody

Following the Chain of Custody involves two main components: ensuring evidence integrity and documenting relevant events.

### Evidence Integrity Hashing

Before conducting analysis, making a forensic copy, or opening the evidence, it is essential to calculate its hash. Hashing, using methods such as MD5 or SHA1, helps quickly verify evidence integrity. Hashes are unique strings that confirm the absence of alterations. Follow these steps:

1. Calculate the evidence's hash before and after handling.
2. Compare the pre- and post-handling hashes to ensure consistency.
3. Use at least two hash algorithms to reduce the possibility of hash collision attacks.

For physical evidence, like an external hard drive, employ a **hardware write blocker** to prevent writing to the device, ensuring read-only access during analysis.

### Taking a Forensic Copy

To preserve the original evidence, it is advisable to create a forensic copy for analysis. Various tools are available for this purpose, ranging from bit-by-bit cloning using the `dd` command in Linux to forensic image generators like the Forensic Toolkit (FTK) and EnCase. By analyzing the copy instead of the original evidence, you minimize the risk of accidental changes.

### Storing Digital Evidence

Physical evidence should be stored in **antistatic bags** to prevent damage caused by electric discharge. For added security, consider using **Faraday cages** to block wireless communication and cellular signals from the device. Ensure that the evidence is stored within a locked container accessible only to authorized examiners. During transportation, keep the evidence under the watch of authorized personnel.

### Chain of Custody Form

Each forensic examiner involved should complete a **Chain of Custody form**. This form serves to record essential details about the evidence and its handling. Include the following information:

1. Description of the evidence.
2. Acquisition or transfer details, including when and where.
3. Examiner contacts for communication purposes.
4. Access, collection, and storage methods used.
5. Other relevant information about the evidence.

The Chain of Custody form ensures a seamless evidence handling process, eliminating potential gaps and providing a means to contact previous examiners if needed.

Remember, maintaining a strong Chain of Custody is vital to preserve evidence integrity and increase its admissibility in court.
