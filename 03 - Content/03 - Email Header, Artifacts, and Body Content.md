- The first things we gather from a malicious or suspect email are artifacts (also referred to as IOCs). We use this information to try to link attacks together into campaigns, identify malicious actors behind the attacks, generate metrics, and perform trend analysis, allowing us to predict what will happen in the near future.
	- We need to include these in our report in a clear and concise way, so they can be found quickly, and other analysts can copy and paste them into different tools or services if needed (such as IOC reputation lookups, internal tools for searching, or sharing with other colleagues).

Email Description:
This email from an Outlook mailbox is posing as Amazon using effective styling and asks the user to click a link to reset their password claiming that the userâ€™s account has been hacked and used to purchase an order of Â£329.99. Using a sense of urgency is a common social engineer tactic, used to make the user rush and not think about whatâ€™s actually happening. The email contains a malicious URL, as it is not pointing to an Amazon-owned domain. Email classed as malicious / credential harvester.
