# SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) is a software solution that combines security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM). It collects and analyzes activity data from various resources across an organization's IT infrastructure, helping to detect threats, facilitate incident response, and conduct forensic investigations. SIEM turns log entries and security events into actionable information by applying rules and statistical correlations.

## SIEM Architecture

SIEM architecture consists of several components, as depicted in the diagram:

1. **Log Sources:** SIEM collects security data from network devices, servers, domain controllers, and other sources.

2. **Correlation Engine:** The correlation engine analyzes the collected data for identifying patterns, anomalies, and potential threats.

3. **Database:** The SIEM stores, normalizes, and aggregates the analyzed data in a database for further analysis and reporting.

4. **Front-End Dashboard:** Security analysts access the front-end dashboard to view and interact with the analyzed data. This allows them to identify, triage, and respond to security events effectively.

Setting up SIEM tools requires understanding the existing network and security infrastructure, configuring log collection from various sources, considering hardware requirements if SaaS storage is not available, and continuously refining rules and reports to detect events of interest and assess overall network risk.

## Benefits of SIEM:

1. **Advanced Threat Detection:** SIEM enables continuous real-time monitoring and correlation across an organization's IT infrastructure, helping to detect, mitigate, and prevent advanced threats such as malicious insiders and data exfiltration.

2. **Forensics and Incident Response:** SIEM assists in forensics investigations by storing and protecting historical logs, providing tools for efficient navigation and correlation of data. It helps security analysts identify security incidents promptly and take immediate remediation steps.

3. **Compliance Reporting and Auditing:** SIEM is often implemented to meet governmental compliance requirements (e.g., HIPAA, PCI/DSS, SOX, FERPA, HITECH). It aggregates log data from across the organization and presents it in an audit-ready format, facilitating compliance reporting and regulatory audits.

Additional reasons businesses may adopt SIEM include data storage, maintaining certifications (e.g., ISO 27000 series), log management and retention, case management or ticketing systems, and policy enforcement validation and detection of policy violations.
