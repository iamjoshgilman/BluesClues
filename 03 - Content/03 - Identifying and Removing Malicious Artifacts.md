# [[03 - Identifying and Removing Malicious Artifacts]]  
---

# Malicious Artifacts
- Malicious artifacts refer to objects with malicious purposes, such as malware, running processes, scheduled tasks, registry entries, or files generated by keyloggers.
- It is essential to identify and remove all malicious artifacts during the incident response process to ensure the system is fully remediated and under control.

# Identifying Artifacts
- Experience in dealing with incidents helps in identifying suspicious artifacts on a system.
- Key areas to check for suspicious activity include active network connections, user accounts, file downloads, running processes, scheduled tasks, and registry entries.
- Manual checks can be conducted to identify artifacts, such as examining running processes using tools like Sysinternals Process Explorer, using netstat and Sysinternals' Process Monitor to track suspicious network connections, and employing tools like Sysinternals' Rootkit Revealer to detect advanced malware or rootkits.

# Removing Artifacts
### Reimaging Affected Systems
- Reimaging the system from a pre-infection backup is a reliable method to completely remove all malicious artifacts.
- This approach ensures a clean system but results in the loss of data after the backup was taken.

### Anti-Malware Solutions
- Scanning affected systems with a high-grade antivirus solution, preferably a Next-Generation Antivirus (NGAV) solution, helps identify and remove malicious artifacts.
- NGAV solutions utilize predictive analytics powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect file-less malware and respond to new threats.
- Ensure the endpoint solution is enabled, properly configured, and up to date for increased chances of successful detection.
- In cases of advanced malware infections, reimaging may be a more effective method of artifact removal.

### Bootable Tools

Some antimalware vendors offer tools or versions of their products that donâ€™t require installation and can be run from a CD or USB drive in order to prevent them from being affected by malware residing on the system. For example:
- McAfee provides the stand-aloneÂ [Stinger Malware removal tool](https://www.mcafee.com/en-us/consumer-corporate/mcafee-labs/free-tools/stinger.html)Â and Microsoft has theÂ [Malicious Software Removal Tool](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=9905), for detecting and removing specific malware.
- Avira offers the â€œ[Avira Rescue System](https://www.avira.com/en/downloads#tab_a3_0)â€œ, designed to be booted and run from a CD or USB drive.

### Removing Malicious Files
- If malicious files are found during incident response, it is advisable to delete them from the system to prevent accidental use by legitimate users or future compromises.

### Deleting Persistence Mechanisms
- Attackers often deploy persistence mechanisms to maintain access to a compromised system.
- Removing persistence mechanisms, such as malicious registry keys, scheduled tasks on Windows, or Cron jobs on Linux-based systems, can disrupt the attacker's access.

Remember: Malicious artifacts include various objects with malicious purposes. Identifying artifacts requires experience and examining areas like network connections, running processes, and registry entries. Removing artifacts can involve reimaging affected systems, utilizing anti-malware solutions (especially NGAV), using bootable tools, deleting malicious files, and removing persistence mechanisms. Select the most appropriate method based on the severity and nature of the incident.
