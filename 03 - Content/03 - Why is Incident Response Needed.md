# [[03 - Why is Incident Response Needed]]  
---

Incident response is crucial to minimize the impact of cyber attacks and ensure business operations remain as uninterrupted as possible. It's impossible to entirely prevent incidents, but the damage can be significantly reduced through effective incident response strategies.

- Cyber attacks can lead to severe consequences such as data breaches, which can cause enormous damage in terms of lost customer trust and business, monetary losses from recovering damaged or infected systems, falling stock prices, and the cost of hiring external security teams to help contain the breach.
- Legal and regulatory fines under legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can also have a massive financial impact. For instance, some notable fines include:
    - Google - â‚¬50 million (January 2019) by CNIL, France.
    - H&M Hennes & Mauritz Online Shop A.B. & Co. KG - â‚¬35.3 million (October 2020) by HmbBfDI, Germany.
    - TIM (Telecom Italia) - â‚¬27.8 million (January 2020) by Garante, Italy.
- Smaller organizations may not survive the financial burden of these fines, forcing them to shut down or change how they operate, such as no longer serving customers within EU countries.

Incident response extends beyond responding to data breaches. It involves dealing with a variety of attack aftermaths, such as:

- Leaked employee credentials
- Database leaks
- Malware infections, like ransomware
- Stolen employee laptops
- Website defacement
- Insider threats (an employee smuggling sensitive data out)

Having written plans for these scenarios reduces the risk by providing a structured response and containment process, which will be covered more in the 'Preparation: Incident Response Plan' lesson.

**Key Point:** If the cost of running an incident response team is less than the cost of a GDPR or other regulatory fine, then the business is saving money!
