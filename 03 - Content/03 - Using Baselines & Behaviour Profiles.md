# [[03 - Using Baselines & Behaviour Profiles]]  
---

Baselining and anomaly-based detection are important techniques used in security operations to identify potential security threats and performance issues. Let's explore the key points to remember:

- Baselining refers to recording and profiling what is considered "normal" behavior on a system or network. It involves establishing a baseline of various factors, such as network utilization, active hours, user activity, and protocol field values.
- Anomaly-based detection compares the current state of the network or system with the established baseline to identify any deviations or anomalies that could indicate a security or performance issue.
- Anomaly-based detection is effective against new and unprecedented attacks and threats that may not be detected by signature-based detection systems.
- Anomaly-based detection can detect malicious activities and behaviors that are hard to define discretely, providing flexibility in threat detection.
- However, anomaly-based detection has limitations. It can generate false positives, especially in complex network environments, and requires time and resources for baselining and analysis.
- Baselining should be performed periodically and after significant changes to the network. It should be fine-tuned to reduce false positives and provide an updated picture of the network.
- Anomaly-based detection can be enhanced by integrating it with other security controls, systems, and procedures. Centralized Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems can aggregate data from various sources, including anomaly detection systems, to provide a comprehensive view of events and facilitate incident response.
- Various tools are available for collecting, analyzing, and displaying network statistics and alerting on anomalies, such as Cisco Stealthwatch, IBM QRadar, and Flowmon ADS.

#### Remember these key points:
- Baselining involves establishing a profile of normal behavior on a system or network.
- Anomaly-based detection compares the current state of the network with the established baseline to identify deviations or anomalies.
- Anomaly-based detection is effective against new and unprecedented attacks, providing flexibility in threat detection.
- Baselining and anomaly-based detection require periodic updates and fine-tuning to reduce false positives and provide an accurate picture of the network.
- Integration with centralized SIEM systems enhances anomaly-based detection and facilitates incident response.
