# [[03 - Identifying Root Cause and Recovery]]  
---

## Identifying the Root Cause
- After containing the incident, removing malicious artifacts, and collecting evidence, the next step is to identify the root cause of the incident.
- The root cause may be immediately apparent in some cases, such as when a user reports opening a suspicious email attachment.
- Analyzing the incident using frameworks like the Cyber Kill Chain or ATT&CK Framework can help map observed stages and investigate hypotheses about the initial infection.
- Forensic analysis of affected systems through the examination of forensic images can reveal actions taken by the attacker during the attack.
- Identifying the root cause is crucial for effective recovery, as leaving the initial entry point open could allow the attacker to regain access.

## Incident Recovery
- Incident recovery involves fixing affected systems and addressing any weaknesses to prevent similar incidents in the future.
- Patching vulnerabilities in programs, operating systems, and security components is essential to prevent future exploitation.
- Disabling unnecessary services on systems helps reduce the attack surface.
- Updating endpoint detection and response (EDR), anti-virus (AV), intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS), and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) rules allows for improved monitoring and alerting.
- Sharing intelligence about the incident, such as indicators of compromise (IOCs), with other organizations helps them improve detection and perform threat exposure checks in their environments.

Remember: Identifying the root cause of an incident is important for effective recovery. Analysis of forensic images and referencing frameworks can assist in identifying the cause. Incident recovery involves patching vulnerabilities, disabling unnecessary services, updating security components, and sharing intelligence to improve detection capabilities. These actions contribute to preventing similar incidents in the future and restoring systems to a secure state.
