The artifacts provide valuable information for digital forensic investigations, such as visited websites, browsing activities, downloaded files, search history, cached webpages, and more. The tools used in this lesson include:

1. KAPE: KAPE is a tool used for digital evidence collection. In this lesson, the browser-based modules of KAPE are utilized to collect information from running systems, specifically targeting Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.

2. Browser History Viewer: Browser History Viewer is a free tool developed by Foxton Forensics. It allows the analysis of browser history by importing the data captured using Browser History Capturer.

3. Browser History Capturer: Browser History Capturer is another tool developed by Foxton Forensics. It is used to forcefully retrieve important files for browser forensics, which can then be imported into Browser History Viewer.
