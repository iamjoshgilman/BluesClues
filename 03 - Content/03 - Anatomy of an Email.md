## Email Header
- set of lines containing information about the message's transportation, such as the sender's address, the recipient's address, or timestamps showing when the message was sent by intermediary servers to the transport agents (MTAs), which act as a mail sorting office. 
- The header begins with theÂ **From**Â line and is changed each time it passes through an intermediary server. 
- Using headers, you can see the exact path taken by the email and how long it took each server to process.

### Header Fields
- TheÂ **message**Â itself, is made up of the two following elements: theÂ **header fields**, a set of lines describing the message's settings, such as the sender, the recipient, the date, etc. An email includes at least the three following headers:
	- `From`, showing the sender's email address
	- `To`, showing the recipient's email address
	- `Date`, showing the date when the email was sent.

### **Optional Header Fields**
- It may also contain the following optional fields:
	- `Received`,Â showing various information about the intermediary servers and the date when the message was processed
	- `Reply-To`, showing a reply address
	- `subject`Â showing the message's subject
	- `message-ID`, showing a unique identification for the message
	- `message body`, containing the message, separated from the header by a line break
