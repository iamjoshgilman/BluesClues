# Strategic Threat Intelligence Analyst: IOC Gathering and Distribution

The strategic threat intelligence analyst plays a crucial role in gathering and distributing indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to support the organization's security operations. They maintain relationships with information-sharing partners and receive government alerts to gather relevant IOCs and TTPs.

These IOCs are passed down to tactical threat intelligence analysts or the wider security team. The tactical analysts perform threat exposure checks using the organization's security tools, such as the SIEM platform, to assess if the organization has been targeted by the same threats.

The strategic analyst also provides situational awareness to the security operations team by sharing information about incidents experienced by industry peers. This helps the organization take proactive defensive measures and stay prepared for potential attacks.

Overall, the strategic threat intelligence analyst ensures the organization receives timely and relevant threat intelligence, empowering them to detect and respond effectively to emerging threats.
