# [[03 - What is Volatility]]  
---

Volatility is an open-source memory forensics framework for incident response and malware analysis. It is written in Python and supports Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux operating systems. Volatility was originally created by computer scientist Aaron Walters, drawing on academic research he did in memory forensics. This is a very powerful tool, and we can complete lots of interactions with memory dump files, such as:

- **List all processes that were running.**
- **List active and closed network connections.**
- **View internet history (IE).**
- **Identify files on the system and retrieve them from the memory dump.**
- **Read the contents of notepad documents.**
- **Retrieve commands entered into the Windows Command Prompt (CMD).**
- **Scan for the presence of malware using YARA rules.**
- **Retrieve screenshots and clipboard contents.**
- **Retrieve hashed passwords.**
- **Retrieve SSL keys and certificates.**
- **And lots more!**
