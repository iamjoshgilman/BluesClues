# [[03 - What Could be Improved]]

Identifying weaknesses in the response to an incident is crucial for organizations to improve their preparedness and response capabilities. By addressing these weaknesses, they can minimize the impact of future incidents and enhance their overall security posture. Here's an overview of how weaknesses can be identified and steps to address them:

## Post-Incident Reflection

- During a post-incident meeting, all stakeholders should reflect on the issues they encountered during the incident response process.
- Questions to consider:
    - Did someone make mistakes in evidence collection?
    - Were there resource limitations, such as insufficient laptops or blank hard drives?
- Identify weaknesses related to tooling, procedures, guidelines, and any individuals or departments that hindered the incident response.
- Assess weaknesses across the stages of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle and consider improvements in terms of resources, personnel, and documentation.

## Initiating Change

- Once weaknesses have been identified, it is essential to ensure that they are addressed and remedied.
- Engage in discussions with management about the need for resources to strengthen incident response capabilities.
- Areas that may require additional budget allocation:
    - Security personnel: Forensic Analysts, Incident Responders, Incident Commanders, etc.
    - Personnel in other departments: Legal, Public Relations, Communications, Human Resources.
    - Tools that support incident response activities.
- Conduct a review of documentation, including run-books, policies, and procedures, to ensure they align with best practices and are updated.

Remember: Identifying weaknesses in incident response is a valuable opportunity to improve preparedness and response capabilities. Through post-incident reflection, organizations can pinpoint areas for improvement, such as tooling, procedures, and resource allocation. Initiating change involves advocating for necessary resources, both in terms of personnel and tools, and reviewing documentation to ensure it reflects current best practices. This continuous improvement approach strengthens incident response capabilities and reduces the impact of future incidents.
