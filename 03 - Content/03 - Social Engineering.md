Social engineering is the practice of exploiting a human as opposed to a system, using psychological methods in order to get them to complete actions that they wouldn't normally do, such as disclosing confidential information, allowing someone into a restricted area without proper authorization, or transferring money to an unverified account. This is no different with phishing. Malicious actors can convince employees that they are someone they know, or even someone in a higher position that has more power than them, and use this deception to get them to complete certain tasks.Â **Phishing is a social engineering attack.**

### **Commonly used social engineering tactics in phishing emails include:**
- Convincing the recipient to reply to an attacker's initial email (recon emails).
- Convincing the recipient to transfer money by posing as the CEO, CTO, CFO, or another employee on the executive board.
- Convincing the recipient to provide the attackers with information that is confidential or private by posing as the data subject or someone in a higher position within the company.
