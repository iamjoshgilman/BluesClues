# Command Line Tools

### IP and ipconfig
- `IP` orÂ `ipconfig`Â on Windows, is a command-line tool that shows the current network configuration of the device that you are on. This includes information such:
	- Current private IP address of the device
	- The gateway address
	- The DNS server
		- Some common examples ofÂ _IP_Â commands include:
			- `ip a`Â - Shows the IP addresses on the device
			- `ip r list`Â - Displays the current routing table on the device
			- `ip link set dev [Device Name] [up|down]`Â - This sets the network interface to either up (enabled) or down (disabled)

### Traceroute and Tracert
- `Traceroute`, orÂ `tracert`Â on Windows, is a command-line tool that allows you to see the path that network packets take when going from one host to another.
- This tool is often used to troubleshoot routing issues between two systems.
	- Some common examples ofÂ _traceroute_Â commands include:
		- `traceroute [url]`Â - Runs the basic traceroute to see the path it takes to get to a specified address
		- `traceroute [url] -p [port number]`Â - Allows the trace to be run with a specific port

### Dig and Nslookup
- `Dig*`, orÂ `Nslookup`Â on Windows (and Linux), is a command-line tool that is used to query DNS servers for information about a specific domain. This tool can often be helpful when you need to quickly search for the IP address of a malicious URL or if you need to find out what mail server a domain routes its emails through.
	- Some common examples ofÂ _dig_Â commands include:
		- `dig [domain name]`Â - Queries the DNS server for the A record for the specified domain
		- `dig [domain name] MX`Â - Queries the DNS server for mail (MX) records for the specified domain
		- `dig [domain name] ANY +nocomments +noauthority +noadditional +nostats`Â - Queries the DNS server for all DNS records for the specified domain and removes the extra information provided by dig

### Netstat
- Netstat is a Linux and Windows-based command-line tool that monitors the TCP and UDP connections on your host system. This tool can often be used for application troubleshooting or if a computer is suspected of containing malware, to see if a system has open connections to remote servers, which could be a sign of it being controlled by a C2 Server
	- Some common examples of netstat commands include:
		- `netstat -a`Â - Displays all of the current connections and listening ports on the system
		- `netstat -a -b`Â - Displays all of the current connections and listening ports on the system, as well as their corresponding executable
		- `netstat -s -p tcp -f`Â - Displays the statistics for all connections using TCP and then displays them in an FQDN format

### Nmap
- Nmap, or Network Mapper, is most often the tool of choice for performing Network Discovery. It is capable of revealing ports, discovering devices on a network, revealing running services, identifying operating systems, and many other functions. All of these capabilities make Nmap an effective, easy-to-use, and versatile tool. Nmap is an open-source tool that comes pre-installed on the Kali operating system, among various other Linux distributions. However, there are also Windows, Mac OS, and other operating system versions on theirÂ [website](https://nmap.org/download.html).
