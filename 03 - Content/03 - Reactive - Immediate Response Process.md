# Immediate Response: Steps for Investigating Phishing Emails

1. **Retrieve an original copy of the phishing email**
2. **Gather artifacts from the phishing email**
3. **Inform the recipients that received the email**
4. **Investigate malicious artifacts to collect indicators of compromise that can be blocked to protect the organization**
5. **Take defensive measures**
6. **Complete the investigation report, documenting all of the above steps**

## 1) Retrieve an Original of the Suspicious Email
To begin the investigation process, the investigating analyst needs to obtain an original copy of the phishing email. This can be done through various methods such as retrieving it from the email gateway, directly from the email solution (e.g., Microsoft Exchange servers), or by having an employee forward the email to a security-owned mailbox.

## 2) Gather Artifacts From the Original Email
It is important to collect artifacts from the original email for further analysis and defensive measures. These artifacts serve as crucial evidence and provide insights into the nature of the attack. 

## 3) Inform Email Recipients
Notifying individuals who have received the phishing email is a vital step in mitigating the risk of interaction with the malicious content. The investigating analyst should use a pre-defined email template provided by the organization, including the following details:
- Date and time of the email
- Subject line of the email
- Clear instructions on how to handle the email (e.g., delete it or forward it to a security-owned mailbox)
- Contact details for further assistance or inquiries

## 4) Artifact Analysis and Investigation
Performing artifact analysis is essential for gathering more information and determining the extent of the malicious elements. Various tools can be employed for this purpose, such as enterprise-grade sandboxing, URL2PNG, VirusTotal, IPVoid, and virtual machines.

## 5) Take Defensive Measures
Taking defensive measures is crucial to minimize the risks posed by the phishing attack. These measures can involve blocking email, web, and file-based artifacts. For example, blocking URLs leading to credential harvesters on a web proxy can prevent employees from accessing the malicious webpage and entering their credentials.

## 6) Complete Investigation Report
A comprehensive investigation report is essential to document the entire process of the immediate response. This report serves as an audit trail and includes detailed notes about the steps performed during the investigation, as well as the defensive measures taken to protect the organization.
