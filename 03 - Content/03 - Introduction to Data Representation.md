# Notes on Binary, Base64, Hexadecimal, Octal, ASCII, and Using CyberChef

## Binary

- Binary uses 0s and 1s to represent OFF and ON states, respectively.
- In computing, 0 represents no flow of electricity, and 1 represents the flow of electricity through a transistor.
- Binary digits (bits) are the building blocks of digital information.
- One bit represents True (1) or False (0) in Boolean logic.
- Multiple binary digits can be used to represent large numbers and perform complex functions.
- Any integer can be represented in binary.
- One byte contains eight bits, allowing for 256 (2^8) different values.
- Files and programs are ultimately collections of binary digits that can be processed by a computer.

## Base64

- Base64 is a reversible encoding algorithm used to transform data into strings.
- It was developed to address issues of encoding compatibility between different systems.
- Base64 converts binary files or images into text strings.
- The encoded Base64 string can be reversed to retrieve the original data.
- Base64 enables the transmission of non-textual content, such as images and videos, via text-based mediums like email or text messages.
- In digital forensics, Base64 can be used to hide media content within seemingly harmless text strings.

## Hexadecimal

- Hexadecimal (hex or base 16) is a numerical system for representing values.
- Hex uses a collection of 16 unique digits: 0-9 and A-F.
- Each hex digit can represent four binary digits (bits).
- Hex is commonly used in programming and computing to represent memory addresses and binary values.
- It provides a concise representation of large numbers compared to binary or decimal systems.

## Octal

- Octal is a numerical system that uses a base of 8.
- It can be used to abbreviate binary numbers by grouping three binary digits into one octal digit.
- Octal numbers are often used to shorten 12-bit, 24-bit, or 36-bit words.
- Each three-digit binary group translates into a one-digit octal number.
- Octal is commonly used in Linux or UNIX file and directory permissions.

## ASCII

- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard.
- It represents alphabetic, numeric, and special characters using 8-bit binary numbers.
- ASCII is widely used for text files in computers and on the Internet.
- Different operating systems may use ASCII or other codes, such as Unicode, for text files.
- Conversion programs allow files to be changed between different encoding standards.

## Using CyberChef

- CyberChef is a tool developed by GCHQ for data encoding, decoding, and various other operations.
- It offers over 100 different operations for data transformation.
- The tool has four main panels: Operations, recipe, input, and output.
- Operations can be dragged into the recipe panel to perform specific transformations.
- Different data formats, including base64, hexadecimal, binary, octal, etc., can be selected from the data format section.
- CyberChef provides functionalities for encoding and decoding data in various formats.
- It can be used for activities like converting Base64 to text, converting hexadecimal strings, encoding to different formats like octal or base64, and more.
- CyberChef is a valuable tool for data representation exercises and analysis.
