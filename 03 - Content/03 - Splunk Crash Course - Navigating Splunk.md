# [[03 - Splunk Crash Course - Navigating Splunk]]  
---

Splunk offers a simple and streamlined GUI, making it easy to work with. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that all SIEMS look fairly similar, so learning how to work with one provides you with transferable skills that can be adapted to the platform that the organization you work for uses. This lesson will cover how Splunk is laid out, and how to navigate through the platform. On the home screen, you will see the below sections, which are explained under the screenshot.

## **Section 1 ‚Äì Apps Panel**

- The¬†**Apps**¬†panel lists the applications that are installed on your Splunk instance. The list shows only the apps that you have permission to view.
- When you first open Splunk Web, you will see the default and pre-installed App,¬†**Search & Reporting**, in the Apps panel.
- Because we have other Apps installed (from configuring BOTSv1) we can see them listed on the left-hand side.

## **Section 2 ‚Äì Splunk Bar**

- The Splunk bar appears on every page in Splunk Web. You use this bar to switch between apps, configure your Splunk deployment, view system-level messages, and monitor the progress of search jobs.

## **Section 3 ‚Äì Explore Splunk Panel**

- The Explore Splunk panel contains links to pages where you can get help.
- You can take a product tour, add data, browse for new apps, or access the documentation.

## **Section 4 ‚Äì Home Dashboard**

- Once dashboards have been created (we‚Äôll cover this later), we can set a dashboard to display on our homepage, which will be visible in the area marked ‚Äú4‚Äù.
- We can use this dashboard to immediately view information that is important to us, such as the number of alerts, types of attacks, and much more.
