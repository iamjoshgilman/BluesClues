# Live Forensics Notes

## Introduction

- Live forensics is a branch of digital forensics focused on collecting evidence from powered-on computers and IT systems.
- Volatile artifacts, which exist only while a system is turned on, can be crucial for investigations.
- Shutting down the system would result in the loss of this volatile data.
- Live forensics techniques allow for the quick acquisition of evidence without jeopardizing other data, especially in cases involving SSDs with features like Garbage Collection or TRIM.

## Importance of Live Forensics

- Modern computers use higher amounts of Random Access Memory (RAM) for caching and serving data quickly.
- RAM often contains valuable evidence that quickly fades once the system is powered off.
- Acquiring this volatile data while the system is online is highly effective.
- Live forensics helps counteract methods used by criminals to hinder analysis, such as full disk encryption, live CDs, and cloud storage.
- Encryption keys can sometimes be extracted from RAM, allowing for the reversal of encryption.
- Cloud and internet-based storage can be detected and downloaded while the system is running and connected.

## Benefits of Live Forensics

1. Preserving volatile data: Live forensics allows for the acquisition of volatile data before it is lost when the system is powered off.
2. Remote access for global organizations: In organizations with offices on different continents, live forensics provides a centralized security team the ability to remotely connect to systems and perform tasks.
3. Actions in live forensics:
   - Viewing running processes: Live forensics enables the examination of processes actively running on a system.
   - Viewing active network connections: Active network connections can be observed during live forensics.
   - Snapshot of RAM: Live forensics facilitates the capture of a snapshot of the RAM for later analysis.

Note: Live forensics is not limited to acquiring volatile data but encompasses various actions performed on powered-on systems to gather evidence and conduct forensic analysis.
