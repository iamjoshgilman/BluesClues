# [[03 - Traffic Light Protocol (TLP)]]  
---

The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is a framework used for sharing sensitive information, including cybersecurity-related data. It was initially developed by the UK Government's National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre to promote the sharing of information while maintaining appropriate levels of confidentiality and trust.

## TLP Classifications:

1. TLP White:
   - Information can be ==publicly shared== while adhering to copyright rules.
   - Reports and updates using TLP White are freely distributed for the benefit of the community.
   - Examples: Publicly available analysis reports on malware, freely shared indicators of compromise.

2. TLP Green:
   - Information can be ==shared within specific communities==, such as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs).
   - It should not be shared publicly on the internet.
   - Examples: Sharing indicators of compromise within an aviation industry ISAC to defend against a specific threat actor.

3. TLP Amber:
   - Information should only be ==shared internally within an organization on a need-to-know== basis.
   - Limits access to sensitive reports, vulnerability scan results, and penetration test reports.
   - Examples: Restricting access to reports containing critical security flaws to specific individuals within the organization.

4. TLP Red:
   - Information is ==highly sensitive== and has severe consequences if disclosed improperly.
   - It should only be shared with authorized recipients listed in the communication or present in the meeting.
   - Examples: Protecting information about ongoing investigations or critical security incidents from unauthorized disclosure.

The purpose of TLP is to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information by clearly defining its distribution restrictions. It enables organizations to share intelligence effectively within trusted circles while minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or unintended consequences.

By adhering to the appropriate TLP classification, organizations can ensure the responsible sharing of information, facilitate collaboration, and enhance the overall security posture.
