# [[03 - Incident Response Glossary]]  
---

- **CERT** (Computer Emergency Response Team): A team responsible for responding to computer security incidents. Most governments have their own CERTs dedicated to security research and defense.

- **CSIRT** (Computer Security Incident Response Team): Another term used to describe teams that respond to security-related incidents. CSIRTs typically consist of security, IT, and personnel from other important business departments such as legal, communications, and human resources.

- **IRP** (Incident Response Plan): An incident response plan is a set of instructions designed to help IT staff detect, respond to, and recover from network security incidents. These plans address issues such as cybercrime, data loss, and service outages that threaten daily work.

- **IOC** (Indicator of Compromise): Intelligence gathered from malicious activity, intrusions, or incidents. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) can include file hashes, file names, IP addresses, or specific patterns that indicate a potential security breach. Sharing IOCs helps organizations identify and block threats.

- **TTP** (Tools, Techniques, and Procedures): MITRE has defined over 240 unique tactics used by adversaries, known as TTPs. These describe the tools, techniques, and procedures employed by threat actors during cyber-attacks.

- **DMZ** (Demilitarized Zone): A demilitarized zone is a physical or logical subnetwork that separates an organization's internal network from an untrusted network, usually the Internet. It contains and exposes external-facing services while providing additional security measures.

- **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response): EDR solutions involve analysis platforms with software agents installed on endpoints. They continuously send information to a central server for correlation, anomaly detection, and response. EDRs can automatically take actions and generate alerts for security analysts.

- **AV** (Antivirus Solution): Antivirus solutions are security software installed on endpoints, such as laptops and desktops, to detect and remove malicious software using signature-based or anomaly-based detection methods.

- **ISAC** (Information Sharing and Analysis Center): ISACs are collectives of organizations operating in the same industries. They share actionable and strategic intelligence about cyber-attacks to improve their defenses and incident response capabilities.

- **IDS/IPS/IDPS** (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System): IDS/IPS/IDPS refers to systems that detect and/or prevent unauthorized network access or malicious activity. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) generate alerts for suspicious activity, while Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can autonomously block or prevent such activities.

- **HIDS** (Host Intrusion Detection System): HIDS is an intrusion detection system installed on a specific host or endpoint, such as a laptop or desktop. It generates alerts when suspicious or malicious activity is detected on that host.

- **HIPS** (Host Intrusion Prevention System): HIPS is an intrusion prevention system installed on a specific host or endpoint. It can automatically take actions when suspicious or malicious activity is detected on that host.

- **NIDS** (Network Intrusion Detection System): NIDS is an intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic and generates alerts when suspicious or malicious activity is detected.

- **NIPS** (Network Intrusion Prevention System): NIPS is an intrusion prevention system specifically designed to detect and respond to suspicious or malicious network traffic. It can perform actions such as blocking or resetting connections.

- **FW** (Firewall): A firewall is a software or hardware device that controls and filters network traffic based on predefined rules. It helps protect networks by allowing or restricting traffic flow. Software firewalls on endpoints are often referred to as local firewalls, while those on internet-facing servers may be known as Web Application Firewalls (WAFs).

- **NGFW** (Next-Generation Firewall): A next-generation firewall combines traditional firewall capabilities with additional network device filtering functions, such as application firewalls using deep packet inspection and intrusion prevention systems.

- **SIEM** (Security Information and Event Management): SIEM refers to a centralized system that collects and analyzes logs and security event information from various sources. It enables real-time analysis of security alerts and provides a comprehensive view of an organization's security posture.

- **GPO** (Group Policy Object): GPOs are collections of Group Policy settings that define what actions a system or user group can perform. They help manage and enforce security policies, reducing the potential for malicious harm by limiting permissions and rights available to users.

- **PCAP** (Packet Capture): A PCAP file is a stored record of network traffic captured for analysis. It contains information about individual packets exchanged over a network.

- **Sysmon** (System Monitor): Sysmon is a Windows utility that provides detailed information about system activity, including process creation, network connections, and registry modifications. It helps security operation centers, defenders, and threat hunters gain insights into potential security events and anomalies.
