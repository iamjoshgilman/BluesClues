# [[03 - Security Event Management (SEM)]]  
---

SEM (Security Event Management) is specialized security software that focuses on identifying, collecting, monitoring, evaluating, notifying, and correlating events and alerts within a computer system. It is designed to identify suspicious behavior within the system and enable an effective and timely response from the security team to any incidents that occur.

## What Does SEM Do?

SEMs primarily monitor and analyze real-time events within an IT system, aiming to detect any anomalous behavior that may indicate an infection, incident, or threat. Key actions performed by SEM software include:

1. **Real-time Event Monitoring:** SEMs continuously monitor events happening within the IT system in real-time.

2. **Security Event Collection:** They obtain security events from devices, applications, and security systems (IDS, IPS, Firewall), as well as specialized software such as antivirus programs.

3. **Event Correlation:** SEMs correlate events to provide a clear understanding of the overall information system, helping to identify patterns and potential threats.

4. **Log Analysis:** Logs are analyzed based on their level of importance, leveraging security algorithms, statistical calculations, and vulnerability databases to identify threats, vulnerabilities, or risks.

5. **Real-time Incident Response:** SEMs enable real-time incident response, facilitating immediate actions to mitigate security incidents.

The information gathered and analyzed by SEMs is then presented to the organization's security team through reports, graphics, and alerts, including SMS notifications in case of severe vulnerabilities.

## Advantages of SEMs:

- **Centralization of Information:** SEMs centralize information from various devices and network elements, providing a comprehensive view of the security landscape.

- **Reduction of False Positives and Negatives:** These systems help reduce false positive and false negative alerts, improving the accuracy of threat detection.

- **Improved Response Time:** SEMs significantly enhance the response time to both internal and external threats, enabling rapid mitigation and minimizing potential damage.

## Disadvantages of SEMs:

- **Complex Deployment:** SEMs can be challenging to deploy within an organization's network infrastructure, requiring careful planning and configuration.

- **High Market Cost:** The cost of acquiring and maintaining SEM software can be relatively high, which may pose financial challenges for some organizations.

- **Automation Limitations:** As automated systems, SEMs can experience occasional failures, leading to false positives or negatives. Regular monitoring and fine-tuning are essential to minimize such issues.

While SEMs provide valuable support to analysts and security teams, it's important to note that automation alone cannot guarantee a secure environment. The goal is not just to analyze a system quickly, but also to maintain its security and functionality over the long term.
