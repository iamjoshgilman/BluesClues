# CVEs and CVSS Scores

- CVEs (common vulnerabilities and exposures) are a method of uniquely tracking publicly-reported vulnerabilities. If someone finds a vulnerability in the Windows operating system, theyâ€™ll report it and apply for a CVE. If granted, a CVE value is generated based on the year and the number of vulnerabilities. An example of this is CVE-2019-0708 which was a critical vulnerability in the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) in 2019
- [https://CVEDetails.com](https://www.cvedetails.com/)Â is a security vulnerability database that has lots of information and can allow us to search for specific CVEs, or even look at vulnerabilities sorted by release date.

## Vulnerability Context

- CVSS scores may not accurately reflect the impact on an organization as it depends on the technology used.
- A vulnerability rated as critical may not affect an organization if it's specific to a technology they don't use.
- Hackers may not exploit highly damaging vulnerabilities due to technical complexity or other factors.
- The presence of active exploitation in the wild increases the risk of a vulnerability.
- Context and tracking exploitation activity are crucial for accurate prioritization of vulnerabilities.

## Predictive Prioritization

- Tenable's predictive prioritization helps focus on the most critical security issues.
- It combines vulnerability data with threat intelligence to provide context and generate new scores.
- The new scoring system, Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR), considers the likelihood of exploitation.
- VPR is a dynamic value that changes based on threat intelligence updates.
- If a previously quiet vulnerability is observed being exploited, its VPR increases in priority.
- VPR helps organizations patch vulnerabilities that pose a higher risk of exploitation.
