---

# Cyber Threat Context

- Dedicated threat intelligence allows for in-depth research on threats.
- Provides historic events and targeting data to assess the likelihood of being targeted.
- Enables proactive defensive measures and reduces the attack surface.
- Gives vulnerability management teams context to prioritize patching.

# Incident Prioritization

- When multiple incidents occur simultaneously, prioritization is crucial.
- Threat intelligence context helps incident responders make informed decisions.
- Prioritization is based on threat actors known to target similar organizations.
- Indicators of compromise enrichment enhances data analysis.

# Investigation Enrichment

- Context is crucial for effective investigations.
- Threat intelligence context can reveal the significance of common events.
- Identifying if an IP is associated with advanced persistent threats (APTs) requires further investigation.
- Information about APT activity helps determine the nature and intent of scanning activities.

# Information Sharing

- Connecting with other organizations' analysts boosts security posture.
- Sharing experiences and tools improves decision-making.
- Early warning signs, such as precursors and indicators of compromise, aid proactive defense.
- Information sharing formats and methods will be covered in the "Strategic Threat Intelligence, IOC/TTP Distribution" lesson.
