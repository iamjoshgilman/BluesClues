# [[03 - Business Email Compromise (BEC)]]

## **Email Compromise & Vendor Attack**
- In this scenario, a legitimate email account belonging to an employee who handles payments to vendors is compromised via credential stuffing, a key logger, or some other initial vector. The attack creates an invoice that is branded to look like it has come from the compromised organization (potentially even by retrieving legitimate invoices and editing the text). This will be sent out to any vendors that are in the address book of the compromised email account, and vendors will potentially pay into a malicious actor-owned bank account.

## **Email Spoofing & Alternative Payment Attack**
- In this scenario either a legitimate email account is compromised or the malicious actor will spoof an email address from the initial organization, and send an email to the target company, offering an alternative payment method for any future payment. If the vendor doesnâ€™t discover this is a spoofed email, they may pay any future payments into the malicious actorâ€™s bank account.

## **Email Spoofing & CEO Fraud**
- In this scenario, the malicious actor is posing as a member of the executive board, such as the CEO, CTO, CFO, etc, and either contacts employees in the finance department, or either the financial institution that the organization uses to hold their money. They use social engineering tactics to create a sense of urgency, and convince the employee theyâ€™re communicating with, that they are in a time-sensitive situation and need money transferred to their bank (actually a malicious actor-controlled account) immediately.

## **Email Spoofing & Data Theft**
- Malicious actors will spoof an employee, and request to see what information is held on them or request tax invoices. This will allow the phisher to get detailed information about an employee, such as their home address, payment information, contact information, and more. This will typically be used for further spear-phishing emails, as they will be extremely effective as they are using real information about the target. This information could also be sold on to other hackers so they can conduct further attacks themselves, such as blackmail or impersonation.

## **Email Compromise & Zombie Phishing**
- Zombie phishing is when a malicious actor compromises an email account, replies to old email threads between one or more contact, and inserts a malicious URL into the email. This is more likely to be clicked, as it will have come from a sender that the recipients are familiar with, and have previous legitimate email communication with. This can be extremely effective if done right.
