# [[03 - Reporting Considerations]]  
---

When writing incident reports or similar documentation post-incident, several considerations should be taken into account. This lesson focuses on the following considerations:

## Report Audience

- Tailor each section of the report to the intended audience, which may include Executive Board members, IT staff, and the broader security team.
- Executive Summary: Keep it concise, avoid technical terms, and explain the incident using business risks and impacts. Highlight the incident discovery, resolution, and potential business consequences if not addressed promptly.
- Rest of the Report: Aimed at technical staff, provide detailed information, annotated screenshots, and use technical language where appropriate.

## Incident Investigation

- Provide detailed information and ensure that any points made are supported by evidence. Avoid speculation without proof.
- Include evidence such as screenshots, logs, or other artifacts to substantiate the findings. Follow the approach of "Make a Point > Provide Evidence."
- Consider incorporating MITRE ATT&CK tactics relevant to the incident, providing insight into the attacker's techniques and goals.

## Screenshots and Captions

- Screenshots are an effective way to provide evidence and enhance understanding.
- Use screenshots to support points made in the report, such as showcasing phishing emails, malicious macros, SIEM logs, or other relevant artifacts.
- Caption each screenshot with a short sentence or two, summarizing the information depicted. This helps readers quickly grasp the content, especially when unfamiliar with specific tools or log formats.

Remember that clear and well-supported documentation is essential for effective incident reporting. Using screenshots and captions can significantly enhance the report's clarity and reinforce the evidence presented.
