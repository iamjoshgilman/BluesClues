# [[03 - Incident Response Lifecycle]]  
---

The Incident Response Lifecycle provides a structured approach to handling computer security incidents. It consists of four distinct phases: Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery, and Lessons Learned. This document will explain each phase individually, emphasizing their significance in preventing recurring incidents.

## Preparation

Being prepared is crucial for effective incident response. Without the right teams, resources, and documentation in place, the incident response process is more likely to fail. Preparation involves two major aspects: preparing for incidents and actively preventing incidents.

Activities involved in preparing for incidents include:

- Maintaining contact information for all stakeholders.
- Establishing a war room for central communication and coordination.
- Documenting incident response procedures and guidelines.
- Establishing baselines for running systems.
- Equipping the incident response team with digital forensic toolkits.

Activities involved in actively preventing incidents include:

- Conducting regular risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities.
- Implementing robust client and server security measures.
- Establishing a user awareness and training program.

While there is no perfect preparation phase, being well-prepared serves as the first line of defense against potential catastrophic damage from an attack.

## Detection and Analysis

The Detection and Analysis phase of incident response consists of two sub-phases aimed at alerting the incident response team of ongoing events and analyzing the attack. Proper implementation of these sub-phases enables timely incident response.

1. **Detection**: Organizations utilize tools such as intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), antivirus/antispam/antimalware software, and log monitoring solutions to detect incidents. Security operations centers (SOCs), internal security teams, and organizations set up these tools to alert the appropriate team when incidents are detected.

2. **Analysis**: Analysis is a complex step that involves determining how the initial attack occurred and how it spreads across the network. Organizations leverage network profiles, baselines, knowledge bases, and log retention policies to aid in incident analysis. It is important for incident responders to effectively document their findings, prioritize actions, and notify the proper authorities, as outlined in a Communication Plan.

With the completion of these two sub-phases, the incident responder can proceed to the next phase.

## Containment, Eradication, Recovery

The Containment, Eradication, and Recovery phase of the Incident Response Lifecycle focuses on ensuring successful recovery from the attack. This phase consists of two sub-phases:

1. **Containment**: Containment strategies vary depending on the nature of the attack. Criteria established by NIST help determine the appropriate containment strategy, considering factors such as potential damage to resources, evidence preservation, service availability, time and resource requirements, effectiveness, and solution duration. Detailed logging of evidence is essential during this phase for further prevention tactics and knowledge sharing within the cybersecurity community.

2. **Eradication and Recovery**: The eradication sub-phase involves removing or neutralizing the threat. This may include rebuilding machines from known good backups, deleting malware, or resetting compromised account credentials. The recovery sub-phase focuses on restoring systems to their pre-attack state, including eliminating exploited vulnerabilities, changing passwords, installing patches, and strengthening network security.

## Lessons Learned

The **Lessons Learned** phase, which takes place after the incident, is crucial for improving existing systems and preventing future incidents. Incident response teams should hold a "lessons learned" meeting to address key questions and gather insights:

- What happened and when did it happen?
- How well did staff and management perform during the incident?
- What information was needed earlier?
- Were there any actions that hindered the recovery?
- What would staff and management do differently in a similar incident?
- How can information sharing with other organizations be improved?
- What corrective actions can be taken?
- What indicators should be monitored in

 the future?
- What additional tools or resources are needed to mitigate future incidents?

Following this meeting, implementing the answers and insights gained from the incident into the Preparation phase allows organizations to learn from the attack and strengthen their defense strategies.

Remember, the Incident Response Lifecycle is an ongoing process, and all four phases are essential in preventing recurring incidents and improving incident response capabilities.
