# [[03 - What are Case Management Tools]]  
---

Case management tools are utilized by Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to record and manage their investigations when responding to security alerts or incidents. These tools are crucial for compliance and operational purposes, allowing analysts to correlate details between cases, document their work, and facilitate collaboration among analysts working on the same investigation.

## Purpose and Functionality
- Case management tools are used to:
  - Record and document investigations in response to security alerts or incidents.
  - Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements by maintaining a formal record of actions taken.
  - Enable collaboration and information sharing among analysts involved in an investigation.
  - Correlate information and identify emerging threats or trends across cases.
  - Facilitate the attachment and management of relevant files and documents.

## Examples of Case Management Tools
Several case management tools are commonly used in real-world security teams, including:
- ServiceNow
- IBM Resilient
- Jira Service Management
- TheHive (open-source tool)

## IBM Resilient: An Example

## Importance of Case Management Tools
- Enable formal documentation of investigations for accountability and compliance.
- Facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among analysts.
- Aid in identifying patterns or trends across cases.
- Streamline the attachment and management of relevant files.
- Enhance overall incident response capabilities.

## Conclusion
Case management tools play a critical role in Security Operations Centers by providing a structured and organized approach to managing and documenting investigations. These tools promote effective incident response, collaboration, compliance, and knowledge sharing within the security team.
