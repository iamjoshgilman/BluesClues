# Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)

In the realm of threat intelligence, Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) play a crucial role in facilitating collaboration and information exchange among organizations operating in the same industry. ISACs are industry-specific groups formed by multiple organizations that aim to share actionable intelligence related to cyber threats, attacks, and indicators of compromise. By joining forces, member organizations can collectively defend against common threats targeting their industry.

ISACs promote the sharing of information that can help organizations take proactive defensive measures and enhance their overall cybersecurity posture. If one member of an ISAC experiences a cyber attack, they can promptly share details about the attack with other members, enabling them to implement proactive measures and prevent similar incidents from occurring in their own networks.

Establishing and maintaining relationships with ISACs, industry partners, government contacts, and agencies can provide organizations with valuable strategic intelligence. This intelligence can power their defense strategies and keep team members informed about emerging trends and campaigns that they may need to address in the future.

One notable example of an ISAC is the Aviation ISAC (a-isac), which consists of organizations operating within the aviation industry. The a-isac serves as a collaborative platform for sharing threat intelligence among member partners, helping them enhance their cybersecurity resilience. Organizations can leverage ISACs to actively participate in online meetings, discuss emerging trends, and exchange strategic intelligence related to threats in their industry.

It's worth exploring different ISACs based on industry verticals. The National Council of ISACs website provides a comprehensive list of member ISACs across various sectors, offering opportunities for organizations to engage in industry-specific threat intelligence sharing and collaboration.

By participating in ISACs and leveraging the collective intelligence of industry peers, organizations can bolster their defenses, stay informed about emerging threats, and actively contribute to the resilience of their industry's cybersecurity ecosystem.
