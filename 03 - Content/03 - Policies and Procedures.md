## Policies
- a plan of intent or course of action towards a particular domain. This could be a countryâ€™s attitude towards an issue or a businessâ€™s plan of responsibility. Policies guide actions in many ways. Some policies are laws or regulations whereas some are principles, direction, or guidelines. They range in complexity, from home to office and government. 
- Policies are at the highest level, followed by procedures and standards, and then guidelines.
- A policy outlines rules and provides principles that guide the actions to be taken, it will set out roles and responsibilities that can be accountable.

## Common Policy Examples
- **Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)**
	- This is a document that stipulates what a user can and cannot do on a corporate, university, or internet service provider (ISP) network and /or internet access. The user agrees to the terms laid out by the policy to gain access to the network. A code of conduct governs the behavior of the user while using the network/internet provided to them; such as no social media or adult content. These policies should outline the consequences in case a user violates this agreement, for example, loss of internet privileges or suspension of the account.
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** 
	- A service level agreement lays out a set level of commitment between a service provider and a customer. For example, an internet service provider or cloud provider will have included a service level agreement when you take out their services. This will dictate; the services provided, performance levels, resolution response times, and repercussions if the service is not provided.
- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)**
	- This is a policy that outlines the usage of a personally owned device on a corporate network, such as a laptop or mobile phone.
- **Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)** 
	- A Memorandum of Understanding is a document that formally outlines an agreement between two or more parties but, is not legally binding. An MOU is usually a sign that a binding contract is imminent.

## Standard Operating Procedures
- A step-by-step set of instructions developed for a routine task. They provide specific technical processes and techniques used to complete a set task. This ensures tasks are performed effectively and efficiently while reducing errors, miscommunication, and failure to comply with regulations.
	- SOPs creates uniformity within the organization.
	- An SOP can be written for almost any task and is periodically reviewed and developed.
