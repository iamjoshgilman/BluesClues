## Deterrents

- Warning signs and barbed wire act as deterrents to discourage potential attackers from attempting to gain entry.
- Warning signs inform individuals that further activity may be illegal and discourage them from proceeding.
- Fences, particularly chain-link metal fences with barbed or razor wire, create barriers that are difficult to climb over and slow down attackers, increasing the chances of detection.
- Security dogs trained to bark and cause distress serve as a strong deterrent, creating the perception of danger to potential intruders.
- Physical security guards act as a visible presence, deterring intruders and increasing the likelihood of apprehension if unauthorized access is attempted.
- Security lighting prevents low visibility areas and enhances the effectiveness of other security measures such as CCTV and security guards.

## Access Controls

- Access controls are implemented to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing specific areas of a building or facility.
- Mantraps require individuals to go through an initial door into a small holding room for inspection before the second door is unlocked, slowing down entry and providing scrutiny.
- Turnstiles or gates with ID pass readers ensure that only authorized individuals can pass through by tapping their ID pass.
- Electronic doors limit access based on an individual's role or authorization level, preventing unauthorized entry into restricted areas.
- Physical security guards can manually check IDs or grant access to authorized individuals based on their credentials.

## Monitoring Controls

- Monitoring controls provide real-time surveillance and enable security personnel to detect and respond to incidents.
- CCTV (Closed-circuit television) systems consist of interconnected cameras that provide expanded visibility and allow for monitoring of multiple areas.
- Physical security guards play a crucial role in utilizing and maintaining monitoring controls, ensuring effective surveillance and response.
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) use various triggers such as thermal detection, sound detection, and movement detection to generate alerts or trigger alarms in the event of unauthorized access.

#### Remember these key points:
- Deterrents like warning signs, fences, guard dogs, security guards, and lighting discourage potential attackers.
- Access controls such as mantraps, turnstiles/gates, electronic doors, and security guards limit access to authorized individuals.
- Monitoring controls, including CCTV systems, security guards, and intrusion detection systems, provide real-time surveillance and response capabilities.
- A combination of physical security measures creates a layered defense to protect against physical intrusions.
