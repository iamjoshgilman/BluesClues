# Sandboxing and Malware Analysis with Hybrid Analysis

Sandboxing is a crucial process in malware analysis that involves running or executing malware in a controlled and isolated environment to monitor its behavior and collect indicators of compromise. Sandboxing allows security teams to gain insights into how the malware operates, which helps in creating defenses and detecting similar malicious activity. While enterprise-grade sandboxing tools exist, we will focus on an online platform called Hybrid Analysis.

## Hybrid Analysis

Hybrid Analysis is an online malware analysis platform that provides instant cloud-based analysis of uploaded malware, offering detailed reports about the observed activity. Here's how you can use it:
