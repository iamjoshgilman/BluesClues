# Public Exposure Checks

Public exposure checks are an essential aspect of security operations as they help threat intelligence analysts assess the information that is publicly available about their organization and identify potential areas of exploitation that could lead to damage. This process involves monitoring various sources to gather intelligence and understand the organization's public footprint.

## Social Media Monitoring

Monitoring social media platforms for any posts, images, or videos shared by employees that may inadvertently disclose sensitive information. This includes being aware of metadata embedded in images, which can reveal device information, timestamps, and even GPS coordinates.

## Leaked Information

Assessing the potential risks posed by publicly shared content that may contain confidential or sensitive details about the organization, such as computer screens, whiteboards with diagrams, or sticky notes with login credentials. Even seemingly innocuous information can be valuable to attackers.

## Early Warning Signs of Insider Threats

Keeping an eye on social media posts or public expressions of discontent by employees, as they may indicate potential insider threats. Monitoring and investigating such indicators can help prevent incidents before they occur.

## Brand Abuse and Impersonation

Monitoring for instances of social media account hijacking or impersonation, where threat actors pretend to be individuals or organizations associated with the targeted organization. Such impersonations can lead to reputational damage, chaos, confusion, or phishing campaigns.

## Data Breach Dumps

Tracking data breaches and assessing their impact on employees and the organization. While personal email breaches are not the direct concern of the security team, breaches involving company email addresses, especially when passwords are leaked, can pose significant risks due to password reuse. Acquiring data breach lists and analyzing them can help identify compromised company-owned email addresses and take appropriate measures.

Threat intelligence analysts, along with security teams and intelligence vendors, work diligently to collect, analyze, and mitigate the risks associated with public exposure. By identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities arising from publicly available information, organizations can enhance their security posture and protect themselves from various threats.
