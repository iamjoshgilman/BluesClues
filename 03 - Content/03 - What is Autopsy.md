# [[03 - What is Autopsy]]  
---

Autopsy is a forensic-grade tool that is used by the military, law enforcement, and corporate examiners to investigate what happened on a smartphone or a computer. Autopsy has a plug-in architecture that allows the user to find add-on modules or even develop custom modules written in Java or Python, providing additional functionality and automation. This awesome tool comes built-in with Kali Linux, and can also be downloaded and used on systems running the Windows operating system for free.
