Emails that are classed as false positives are messages that haveÂ **not**Â been sent by a malicious actor and are instead legitimate emails that have been incorrectly reported as malicious. There are a number of reasons that false positives can occur:

- **The user believes the email is malicious or potentially malicious**
- **The email has poor formatting**Â (usually internal emails)Â **and appears to be suspicious**
- **The email is unexpected and asks the user to complete an action**Â (click this button, contact us immediately, transfer funds to this account, etc)
- **The user is not familiar with identifying malicious emails due to a lack of phishing awareness training**
