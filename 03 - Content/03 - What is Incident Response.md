# [[03 - What is Incident Response]]  
---

## Incident response is the methodology that organizations use to respond to and manage cyber attacks.

- Security events are typically handled by security analysts within a Security Operations Centre (SOC), while security incidents are managed by specialist incident responders.
- The actions taken by security professionals during a cyber attack are crucial to analyze, contain, and eradicate the threat, limiting the damage caused and restoring operations to normal as quickly as possible.
- Incident response is a reactive approach closely aligned with disaster recovery efforts.
- Preparation is an essential stage in the incident response lifecycle, involving the consideration and deployment of security controls to minimize the likelihood and impact of successful cyber attacks.
- Incident response efforts can save businesses money by reducing recovery time and costs.
- Organizations can learn from weaknesses identified during incident response by taking detailed notes and expanding on existing incident response plans and run-books.
- Large organizations often have a dedicated team called a CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team) that comprises not only security professionals but also general IT staff, employees from departments such as HR, communications/public relations, legal, and C-suite level members.
