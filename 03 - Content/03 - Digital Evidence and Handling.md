## Digital Evidence Forms

Digital evidence can take various forms in investigations and DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) activities.
- Common forms of digital evidence include:
  - E-mails: Written communication between individuals, may contain file attachments.
  - Digital Photographs: Photos as evidence, metadata can provide additional information.
  - Logs: System logs with various information, such as login times.
  - Files: User files like notes, code, images, and installed software.
  - Messages: Text messages, iMessage, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp conversations.
  - Browser History: Records of accessed websites and resources.
  - Backups: Deleted files may be recoverable from backups.
  - Video/Audio Files: Evidence in themselves, metadata can provide additional context.

## Trustworthiness of Digital Evidence

- Digital evidence can be more voluminous, difficult to destroy, easily modified, duplicated, and readily available.
- Courts may treat digital evidence differently regarding authentication, hearsay, best evidence rule, and privilege.
- Authenticity of digital evidence can be questioned due to ease of modification, but courts are increasingly requiring proof of tampering.
- Hash values are useful for imaging hard drives to ensure data integrity.

## Evidence Handling

- Proper handling and securing of evidence are crucial to maintain forensic soundness.
- Mistakes in evidence acquisition can taint the evidence and prevent its admission in legal proceedings.
- Key principles of evidence handling include:
  - Not altering the original evidence.
  - Using write-blockers to prevent changes to original/suspect media.
  - Documenting all actions taken, including detailed notes, diagrams, and photographs.
  - Proper documentation helps reconstruct the chain of events and maintain evidence integrity.
