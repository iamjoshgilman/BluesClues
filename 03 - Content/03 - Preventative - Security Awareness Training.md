# Awareness Training

- Users should undergo in-person or online training during onboarding to learn how to spot phishing emails.
- Training should cover identifying characteristics of phishing emails.
- Employees who can spot common issues with phishing emails are less likely to click on malicious artifacts, reducing security incidents.
- Identifying and reporting phishing emails that land in their mailboxes is essential.

# Simulated Phishing Attacks

- Security-conscious organizations conduct simulated phishing attacks against employees to assess the effectiveness of security awareness training.
- Simulated attacks involve customizing emails sent to employees' mailboxes.
- Clicking on a "malicious" link redirects users to a safe website, and they are informed they fell for a phishing email.
- Security teams monitor the number of reported phishing emails to identify employees who understand the training and can identify suspicious emails.
- Regular simulated phishing events help test employees and identify those consistently falling for phishing emails.
