## Router
- A router is a network device that forwards data based on a logical address.

## Hub
- A hub is a network device that connects all devices on a Local-Area-Network or LAN. When a system sends data to the hub on one port, the hub will broadcast these to all other attached devices. Known as "Dumb" devices.

## Switch
- A switch works as a smart version of a hub because it actually understands where to send data, instead of sending it to everyone. It achieves this by using MAC addresses as unique identifiers for recipients of incoming data, so it can send it to the right system.

## Bridge
- A network bridge device works to connect separate networks to make them into one larger network. This is different than a router, which allows networks to be connected but work independently. In the OSI model, bridging works at Layer 2, the Data Link Layer.

## Firewall
- A firewall is a network device that provides fundamental network security, by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic and determining whether to allow or block it, based on rules.
	- Can be physical hardware or software
