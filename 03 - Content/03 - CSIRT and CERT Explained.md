# [[03 - CSIRT and CERT Explained]]  
---

- ## CSIRT (Cyber Security Incident Response Team) 
- ## CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) 

are specialized teams formed by companies and governmental bodies to respond to cyber-attacks and coordinate incident response efforts. These teams play a crucial role in addressing IT security incidents and assessing their impact on the organization or government entity. CSIRTs typically comprise stakeholders from various business units, including infrastructure, networking, legal, public relations, communications, and security, enabling them to address all aspects of the organization during emergencies.

## Importance of CSIRTs

CSIRTs are important in the digital world due to their vital functions, which include:

1. **Central Communication Point**: CSIRTs establish a command center where all incident-related information is managed, ensuring effective communication and coordination during an incident response.

2. **Security Awareness and Training**: CSIRTs promote security awareness and conduct training programs, such as phishing exercises, to enhance the cybersecurity knowledge and vigilance of employees within the organization.

3. **Emergency Contact Group**: CSIRTs act as the primary contact group for the organization regarding all cybersecurity-related matters, providing a dedicated channel for reporting and addressing incidents.

4. **Threat Investigation and Response**: CSIRTs investigate new security vulnerabilities and threats, develop plans to mitigate and respond to these incidents if exploited within the organization, and work towards reducing Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) and Mean Downtime (MDT) for the company's assets.

5. **Information Sharing and Collaboration**: CSIRTs share valuable information and insights with other CSIRTs and the broader cybersecurity community, contributing to collective knowledge and strengthening the overall security posture.

## Public vs Private CSIRTs

The nomenclature used for incident response teams can vary across organizations and countries. While CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) is commonly associated with government-sponsored teams, other terms such as Security Incident Response Team (SIRT), Incident Response Team (IRT), or Computer Security Incident Response Centre (CSIRC) may be used by private organizations. While the term CERT is often used for nationally recognized response teams, CSIRTs are typically internal teams within businesses that handle cybersecurity incidents.

## Case Study: New Zealand CERT

Numerous countries have government-sponsored CERTs that aim to protect businesses and individuals within their jurisdiction and assist other CERTs in incident response efforts. These CERTs maintain visibility to the public and often publish quarterly and annual reports detailing reported incidents and their response activities. A notable example is the New Zealand CERT, which publishes annual reports outlining the incidents observed throughout the year and their corresponding response actions.

CSIRTs and CERTs are instrumental in responding to incidents, mitigating the impact of cyber-attacks, and fostering collaboration and information sharing to strengthen cybersecurity practices across organizations and countries.
