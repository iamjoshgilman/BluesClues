# [[03 - ACPO Principles]]  
---

The ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) Good Practice Guide outlines essential principles for handling computer-based electronic evidence. Adhering to these principles ensures that digital evidence is treated in a manner consistent with other types of evidence presented in court. Here are the key principles:

## Principle 1: Preservation of Data

The first principle emphasizes that no actions should be taken that could alter the data on a digital device, such as a computer or mobile phone, which may serve as evidence in court. It is crucial to preserve the integrity of the original data from the point of seizure when it comes under the possession of the police. This includes ensuring that the data remains unchanged throughout the investigative process.

## Principle 2: Competency and Explanation

When it becomes necessary to access the original data on a digital device, the person performing this task must be competent in handling digital evidence. They should be capable of explaining their actions and the implications of those actions on the digital evidence to the court. The individual's competence is essential to ensure that the integrity of the evidence is maintained and to provide clear and accurate explanations of the processes carried out.

## Principle 3: Documentation and Audit Trail

A trail or record of all actions taken with the digital evidence should be created and preserved. This includes documenting the processes, techniques, and tools used during the investigation. The documentation should be comprehensive and transparent to allow an independent third-party forensic expert to examine and verify the processes undertaken. The aim is to enable another examiner to replicate the same processes and arrive at the same conclusion.

## Principle 4: Responsibility of the Investigator

The individual leading the investigation holds the overall responsibility for ensuring that the ACPO principles are followed consistently throughout the investigation. This includes overseeing the preservation of evidence, verifying the competency of individuals handling the evidence, and ensuring proper documentation and auditing procedures are in place. The investigator plays a critical role in upholding the integrity and admissibility of the digital evidence in court.

By adhering to these principles, investigators can maintain the integrity of computer-based electronic evidence, facilitate a transparent and accountable process, and increase the likelihood of the evidence being accepted and trusted in a court of law.
