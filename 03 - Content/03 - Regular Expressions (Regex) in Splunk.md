### Splunk Commands

|Command|Description|
|---|---|
|`rex field=_raw "expression"`|Extracts data from a field using regular expressions.|
|`rex field=fieldName "expression"`|Extracts data from a specific field using regular expressions.|

### Practical Examples

#### Usernames

Usernames often consist of alphanumeric characters. The `\w` character class is perfect for this.

- Regex: `(?<username>\w+)`
- Splunk command: `rex field=_raw "username=(?<username>\w+)"`

#### Passwords

Passwords can contain a mix of alphanumeric and special characters. To capture passwords you might use a regex that captures one or more non-whitespace characters.

- Regex: `(?<password>[^\s]+)`
- Splunk command: `rex field=_raw "password=(?<password>[^\s]+)"`

#### Filenames

Files often have a name, followed by a dot, then an extension. You might use a regex that captures this pattern.

- Regex: `(?<filename>\w+\.\w+)`
- Splunk command: `rex field=_raw "filename=(?<filename>\w+\.\w+)"`

#### IP Addresses

An IP address is four numbers (0-255) separated by dots. The following regex can be used to capture these.

- Regex: `(?<ipaddress>\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b)`
- Splunk command: `rex field=_raw "ipaddress=(?<ipaddress>\b\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\b)"`
