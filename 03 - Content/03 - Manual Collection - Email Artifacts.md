1. To extract the **Sending Server IP** (X-Sender-IP), use the Find feature (CTRL+F) and search for "IP." The first string found should be the X-Sender-IP.

2. Convert the IP address into a **hostname** by performing a reverse DNS lookup. Use a free online service like [Domain Tools](https://whois.domaintools.com/) to retrieve information about the server.
