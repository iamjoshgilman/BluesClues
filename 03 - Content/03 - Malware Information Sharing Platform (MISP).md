# [[03 - Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)]]  
---

The Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) is an open-source software solution developed by a community of volunteers. It serves as a comprehensive platform for collecting, storing, distributing, and sharing cyber security indicators and threats. MISP is designed to support the analysis of cyber security incidents and malware by incident analysts, security professionals, and malware reversers.

# What Does MISP do?
- Facilitate the storage of technical and non-technical information about seen malware and attacks
- Create automatically relations between malware and their attributes
- Store data in a structured format (allowing automated use of the database to feed detection systems or forensic tools)
- Generate rules for Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that can be imported on IDS systems (e.g. IP addresses, domain names, hashes of malicious files, pattern in memory)
- Share malware and threat attributes with other parties and trust-groups
- Improve malware detection and reversing to promote information exchange among organizations (e.g. avoiding duplicate works)
- Create a platform of trust â€“ trusted information from trusted partners
- Store locally all information from other instances (ensuring confidentiality on queries)

MISP plays a crucial role in enabling the storage of technical and non-technical information related to malware and attacks. It allows for the creation of relationships between malware samples and their attributes, storing data in a structured format for automated use in detection systems or forensic tools. Additionally, MISP enables the sharing of malware and threat attributes with trusted parties, improving malware detection, and promoting information exchange among organizations.

Key Features of MISP:
- Storage of technical and non-technical information about malware and attacks.
- Automated correlation to identify relationships between attributes and indicators.
- Support for different models of data distribution, including private, community-only, connected communities, and public sharing.
- Sharing groups tailored to specific sectors, such as the financial sector.
- User-friendly interfaces, including a web interface for analysts and a ReST API for IOCs integration.
- Efficient IOC and indicators database for effective storage and retrieval.
- Advanced correlation engine with support for fuzzy hashing correlation and CIDR block matching.
- Export and import capabilities for integration with other systems, including IDS, OpenIOC, STIX, CSV, and more.
- STIX support for importing and exporting data in version 1 and version 2 formats.
