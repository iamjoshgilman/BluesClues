Spam emails (also known as "junk mail") are messages that are unsolicited, unwanted, or unexpected but are not necessarily malicious in nature. Examples of spam emails are:

- **Newsletters that the user has unknowingly signed up for**
- **Marketing emails trying to promote products and services**
- **Update announcements from companies and services the user has registered with**

Spam emails should not be confused with malicious spam emails (malspam for short). Malicious spam emails are malicious messages that are sent on a mass scale (as opposed to being targeted at an individual or organization).
