# [[03 - Digital Forensics Process]]

The digital forensic process is a scientific and forensic method used in digital investigations, particularly in law enforcement. It involves five steps: Identification, Preservation, Collection, Analysis, and Reporting. The process aims to recover digital evidence to support or disprove hypotheses in legal or civil proceedings.

1. **Identification**Â â€“ The first stage identifies potential sources of relevant evidence or information (devices), as well as key custodians and location of data.
2. **Preservation**Â â€“ The process of preserving relevant electronically stored information (ESI). This is done by protecting the crime or incident scene, capturing visual images of the scene, and documenting all relevant information about the evidence and how it was acquired.
3. **Collection**Â â€“ Collecting digital information that may be relevant to the investigation. Collection may involve removing the electronic device(s) from the crime or incident scene and then imaging, copying or printing out its (their) content.
4. **Analysis**Â â€“ An in-depth systematic search of evidence relating to the incident being investigated. The outputs of the examination are data objects found in the collected information. These outputs may include system and user-generated files. The analysis aims to draw conclusions based on the evidence found.
5. **Reporting**Â â€“ Reports are based on proven techniques and methodology and other competent forensic examiners should be able to duplicate and reproduce the same results.

A crucial activity that accompanies the first four steps isÂ contemporaneous notetaking. This is the documentation of what you have done immediately after you have completed it and should provide sufficient detail for another person to reproduce what you have done from the notes alone. The chain of custody, which we cover later in this domain, should also be followed at every stage of the investigation to ensure that evidence integrity is not compromised.
