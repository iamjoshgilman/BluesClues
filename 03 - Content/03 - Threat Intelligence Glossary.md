# [[03 - Threat Intelligence Glossary]]  
---

Sure! Here's the reformatted glossary post with terms starting with "##":

## TIP (Threat Intelligence Platform):
A platform typically used to store indicators of compromise (IOCs) and intelligence reports. It powers defenses like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, generates watchlists, and provides event context in platforms such as endpoint detection and response (EDR) and security information and event management (SIEM) solutions.

## TEC (Threat Exposure Check):
The process of manually or autonomously checking an environment for the presence of malicious indicators, such as email subject lines, email sending addresses, malware hashes, and observed network activity connected to malicious IP addresses.

## EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response):
An analysis platform with software agents that run on endpoints, continuously sending information to the EDR server for correlation, detecting anomalies and security events. EDRs can be configured to take automatic actions, such as stopping network connections, and generate alerts for security analysts to investigate.

## IDS/IPS/IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System):
Systems with intrusion detection functionality report on unusual or suspicious activity by generating alerts and logs. Intrusion prevention functionality autonomously stops attempts without needing human intervention.

## CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence):
The practice of threat intelligence in the cyber realm. It involves attributing threat actors to cyber activity and sharing intelligence to allow defenders to respond or prepare for cyber-attacks.

## IOC (Indicator of Compromise):
Intelligence gathered from malicious activity, intrusions, or incidents. Examples include malware observed in an attack against an organization. File hashes and names can be shared with other organizations to add them to blocklists or perform threat exposure checks.

## TTP (Tools, Techniques, and Procedures):
Over 240 unique tactics defined by MITRE used by adversaries. Detailed descriptions and known threat actors using them can be found at MITRE's website.

## MD5 (Message Digest 5 Hashing Algorithm):
A widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 has vulnerabilities, it can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity.

## SHA1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):
A cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit hash value. Typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.

## SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256):
A one-way function that converts text of any length into a 256-bit string. It is a cryptographically secure hashing function, revealing little about the input.

## APT (Advanced Persistent Threat):
A well-resourced and technically sophisticated threat actor, often linked to a country's government. APTs focus on covert, long-term cyber operations to complete objectives without detection.

## OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence):
Intelligence or information collected from publicly-available sources, such as social media, search engines, and websites that do not require registration or payment.

## MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform):
An open-sourced threat intelligence platform that allows organizations to store threat intelligence information and create information sharing and analysis centers by inviting other organizations to access the server.

## DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service):
An attack where hundreds or thousands of systems send traffic to a target, using up its resources. This attack typically targets web servers, preventing people from loading a website.

## CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures):
The naming convention given to vulnerabilities in software and hardware, enabling easier sharing of information related to specific weaknesses.

## CVSS (Common Vulnerability Severity Scoring):
The scoring system used to classify the severity of vulnerabilities based on factors such as technical sophistication, exploitation vector, and privileges needed for successful exploitation.

## RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol):
A Windows protocol that allows users to access other Windows systems using a graphical user interface. It can be used by system administrators or malicious actors to move around a network.

## VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating):
A vulnerability scoring system created by Tenable that rates vulnerabilities based on the likelihood of exploitation and the impact of successful exploitation, utilizing threat intelligence context.

## SIGINT (Signals Intelligence):
The interception of radio signals and broadcast communications to gather intelligence.

## COMINT (Communications Intelligence):
Intelligence relating to communications between people and groups, often synonymous with SIGINT.

## ELINT (Electronic Intelligence):
Intelligence collected from systems not used directly for communications, such as guidance communication for missile systems and radars.

## UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle):
An aerial vehicle flown autonomously or remotely, with no human pilot onboard. Examples include reconnaissance drones.

## HUMINT (Human Intelligence):
Gathering intelligence from other humans through in-person meetings, debriefings, observation, and document gathering. It can be attained through espionage or open communications between diplomats.

## GEOSINT (Geospatial Intelligence):
The use of satellite imaging to monitor activities such as tracking individuals of interest, structural reconnaissance, military movement location and tracking, and monitoring natural disasters.

## FIN (Financially Motivated Threat Actor):
The name given to financially motivated threat actors associated with cybercrime activity and practices, as defined by security and intelligence firm FireEye.

## UNC (Unclassified Threat Actor):
Groups undergoing analysis are referred to as "UNC" or Unclassified under the FireEye/Mandiant naming convention.

## ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis Center):
A collective of organizations, typically operating in the same industries, that share actionable and strategic intelligence surrounding cyber attacks. The goal is to improve each other's defenses and ability to respond to security events and incidents.
