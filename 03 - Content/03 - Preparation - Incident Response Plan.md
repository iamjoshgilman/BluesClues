An incident response plan (IRP) is crucial for effectively responding to security incidents. It provides a clear and defined process for IT and security staff, minimizing confusion and saving valuable time. The IRP should be regularly updated and accompanied by continuous training to ensure all employees involved in incident response are capable of performing their duties.

## Structure of an Incident Response Plan
IRPs typically consist of the following six sections:
1. Preparation
2. Identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons Learned

**Sample incident response plans:**
- [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/iso/governance/procedures/docs/incidentresponseplan1.0.pdf)â€”including definitions, roles and responsibilities, methodology, incident response phases, guidelines for insider threats and interaction with law enforcement, and documentation.
- [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu/information-technology/policies/incident-response-plan)â€”including scope, response steps, usage of security tools, and an intrusion checklist.

## Preparation Phase
The preparation phase is vital and requires attention both during plan development and ongoing training of team members. This section can be divided into three main phases:

### 1. Developing Response Plans and Simulated Scenarios
- Create response plans for different incident types.
- Conduct simulated scenarios to evaluate the response of the incident response team.
- Train the team for real incidents.

### 2. Provisioning Resources
- Ensure that all necessary resources for incident response are approved and readily available.
- Resources may include laptops, notebooks, software tools, forensic equipment, training materials, and the ability to prioritize incident response over regular responsibilities.

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- Continuously train and assess the performance of incident response team members.
- Evaluate team members' ability to fulfill their defined duties in the response plans.
- Examples of specific responsibilities include analyzing and collecting information for security analysts, acquiring and preserving digital evidence for forensic analysts, and drafting notifications for PR/communications departments.

## Identification
The identification section focuses on recognizing and analyzing security incidents. It provides guidance on reporting incidents and gathering relevant information, such as:

- Incident occurrence time
- Discoverer of the incident (security team member or another employee)
- Discovery method
- Affected systems or business units
- Impact on organizational operations
- Incident scope (number of affected systems, initial point of entry, and damage caused)

Organizations may assign criticality and impact levels to prioritize multiple incidents:

- Criticality level: The speed at which the response is required
- Impact level: The duration of the incident's impact on business operations

## Containment
Containment aims to prevent the incident from spreading further and causing additional damage. This section outlines actions to be taken for containment, such as:

- Disconnecting compromised devices from the internet to prevent remote access
- Powering off affected systems

Key considerations during containment:

- Carefully select containment measures to preserve digital evidence for analysis.
- Document guidelines and procedures for evidence acquisition and containment.
- Maintain backups to replace affected systems temporarily, ensuring uninterrupted business operations.

## Eradication
The eradication stage involves analyzing the incident to determine its cause and removing any malicious artifacts. Steps for eradication include:

- Using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to identify previous attack steps.
- Analyzing packet captures and SIEM logs.
- Removing malware, unauthorized changes, and methods used by attackers to retain persistence.
- Strengthening systems by applying patches, hardening configurations, and implementing automated defenses (e.g., NIPS and HIPS) based on indicators of compromise.

Creating run-books for different incidents enables quick evaluation and implementation of preventive measures.

## Recovery
The recovery stage focuses on returning business operations to normal. Steps for recovery include:

- Moving cleaned and hardened systems back to production environments.
- Ensuring systems are no longer infected.
- Providing guidelines for proper system restoration.
- Example: Using a backup server temporarily while cleaning an infected web server and then returning the main site to the primary server.

## Lessons Learned
After completing the investigation and response, hold a meeting involving stakeholders to discuss the incident. The objectives of this meeting include:

- Recapitulating the incident and identifying strengths

 and weaknesses in the response.
- Identifying improvements for future incident response.
- Strengthening systems by updating documentation, policies, and procedures.
- Allocating additional budget for tools or personnel if necessary.

## Conclusion
Incident response is a challenging process, but learning from mistakes and security gaps enhances defenses and elevates the organization's security posture. A well-maintained incident response plan requires constant updates and routine training. Tabletop exercises and simulated attacks help maintain readiness and involve all relevant stakeholders.
