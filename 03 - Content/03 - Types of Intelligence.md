# Sigint

Signal intelligence involves the interception of radio signals and broadcast communications to gather intelligence. This came about as early as the First World War. These come from communication systems, weapons systems, and radar transmissions. 
SIGINT falls under two different categories:

- `COMINT`Â **â€“**Â Communications intelligence related to communications between people and groups of people (messages and voice) and is often synonymous with SIGINT, even though it is considered a discipline of SIGINT.
- `ELINT`Â **â€“**Â Electronic intelligence is collected from systems not used directly for communications, such as guidance communication for missile systems and radars.

# OSINT

Open-source intelligence is information that is gathered from public sources. The amount of information that can be used to detect, track, or stop threats is almost endless. This is also a double-edged sword, in that bad actors can utilize the same information to plan cyber attacks.

Types of information that can be gathered are:
- Driving records
- Telephone numbers
- Street addresses
- Social messaging and social network information
- Email addresses
- Domain names
- And much more

# HUMINT

human intelligence (HUMINT) is gathered from other humans. Being effective in this discipline requires an understanding of how humans feel, think, and act, which can vary from person to person. This intelligence is often gathered through in-person meetings, debriefings personnel tasked with acquiring information through observation, document gathering, etc. Such information can be attained through espionage or open communications between diplomats, for example.

# GEOINT

Geospatial intelligence (GEOSINT) is the body of intelligence that helps these modes of engagement possible during times of natural disasters, wartime, or through other major events, such as political turmoil. Satellite imaging is highly used to provide intelligence personnel with targets, landmass structures, and whether theyâ€™re manmade or natural, where our militaries are and their enemies, to better coordinate attack and defense efforts. This also allows aid to allies during times of natural disasters, so first-responders can better identify the state of their deployment.
