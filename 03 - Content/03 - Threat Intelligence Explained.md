**‚Äúthreat intelligence is information that an organization uses to understand the threats that are currently targeting them, or could target them in the future‚Äù**

# Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

Threat intelligence is all about gathering raw data and transforming it into intelligence that has value and can actually be used.

## 1. Planning and Direction

This is the most crucial part, as it determines what the scope is for this specific threat intelligence project. Goals need to be set, and the stakeholders need to be clearly defined. This helps the project to stay on track, and not waste time or resources working on intelligence that is not important.

- **Research and learn more about the hacking group, including who is involved, and how skilled/sophisticated they are.**
- **Check for public exposure in order to understand the attack surface of the organization**¬†(the total number of ways hackers could break into a network. If a company had all of its systems fully patched, it would have a small attack surface, however, if patches were not applied there are more security flaws attackers can take advantage of).
- **Discover the most appropriate actions that can be taken to defend against this threat**.

## 2. Collection

This is the stage where the team will go out and collect all of the data they need to achieve their end goal of creating actionable intelligence.

- Scraping as many posts from the underground forums
- Performing OSINT searches to try to find information on the group
- Anything else they agree is in scope as defined in phase 1

Mature threat intelligence teams typically use a centralized threat intelligence platform such as MISP, to store indicators and indicators of compromise from a range of public and private threat feeders, which are lists of actionable intelligence shared between organizations.

## 3. Processing

Now that the team has a vast amount of data, they need to transform it into a clear and readable format so that it can be analyzed, typically by human threat intelligence analysts.

- If the posts were not written in English, they would need to be expertly translated to ensure that the exact information was maintained.

## 4. Analysis

This stage involves a human process where processed information (from the previous step) is turned into actionable intelligence that can be used.

- Decisions might involve whether to investigate a potential threat
- What actions to take immediately to block an attack
- How to strengthen security controls
- How much investment in additional security resources is justified

This information needs to be presented in an appropriate manner based on the audience. If a technical threat intelligence piece was being passed to security analysts then it can remain technical. if it is a more strategic piece being presented to a typically non-technical audience then it needs to be simpler and not use jargon.

## 5. Dissemination

Dissemination involves getting the finished intelligence output to the places it needs to go. This can be SOC or Security Analyst, fellow Threat Intelligence Analysts, and even the executive board.
For each of these audiences, you need to ask:

- What threat intelligence do they need, and how can external information support their activities?
- How should the intelligence be presented to make it easily understandable and actionable for that audience?
- How often should we provide updates and other information?
- Through what media should the intelligence be disseminated?
- How should we follow up if they have questions?

## 6. Feedback

It is critically important to understand your overall intelligence priorities and the requirements of the security teams that will be consuming the threat intelligence. Their needs guide all phases of the intelligence lifecycle and tell you:

- What¬†types of data¬†to collect
- How to process and enrich the data to turn it into useful information
- How to analyze the information and present it as actionable intelligence
- To whom each type of intelligence must be disseminated (as mentioned in the dissemination stage), how quickly it needs to be disseminated, and how fast to respond to questions
