At a post-incident meeting, all appropriate stakeholders should gather to review the incident from start to finish. Some examples of discussion points could include:

- **Who performed well?**
- **Were any new tools or processes used that provided benefit?**
- **Review the metrics that have been collected from the incident.**
- **Review the communication between different company departments.**

Identifying areas where the security team and other departments operated well should be highlighted, and these should be properly recorded within run-books so that the same approach can be used in future incident responses.
