## Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), are the actions taken by threat actors when conducting cyber attacks. They provide valuable insights for defenders to understand the tactics employed by different threat groups and gather intelligence to enhance security operations. MITRE's ATT&CK Framework categorizes TTPs into 12 different groups:

1. Initial Access
2. Execution
3. Persistence
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Defense Evasion
6. Credential Access
7. Discovery
8. Lateral Movement
9. Collection
10. Command and Control
11. Exfiltration
12. Impact

### Understanding TTPs: Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through an example to illustrate the importance of TTPs in understanding and defending against cyber attacks. Suppose security analysts at Organization A discover a script involved in exfiltrating data. This action would be mapped to a specific TTP, in this case, T1020. With this information, the security analysts and incident response team can trace back the attack, identifying how the attackers gained initial access, executed further activities like privilege escalation and lateral movement. This attack path can provide a comprehensive understanding of the attack, help prevent similar incidents, and aid in incident response.

### Mitigations and Proactive Defense

Each TTP in the MITRE ATT&CK Framework also provides guidance on mitigations and detection. For instance, TTP T1020 suggests implementing network segmentation, restricting unnecessary protocols and services, and monitoring network traffic to detect abnormal data transfers. Over time, defenders can accumulate attack paths for different incidents, potentially leading to attribution of specific threat groups.

 **Proactive defense involves taking preemptive measures rather than waiting for attacks to occur. Organizations can proactively assess their security controls and monitoring capabilities to detect and prevent attacks utilizing known TTPs. Conducting penetration tests with specific attack paths and referring to threat group TTPs listed by MITRE can help organizations evaluate their defenses and implement necessary improvements.**

By leveraging TTP knowledge, organizations can strengthen their security posture, enhance threat detection capabilities, and stay one step ahead of potential attackers.
