### Access Controls

- **Mantraps:** 
	- These are a slow but effective security control, where an individual wanting to access a protected area must go through an initial door into a holding room, where they are inspected from a window or camera before the second door is unlocked.
- **Turnstiles/Gates:** 
	- This efficient control is very common in office buildings and requires employees to tap their ID pass on a reader, which will unlock the gate and allow them to pass through.
- **Electronic Doors:** 
	- These secure doors should be used throughout the facility, to limit the areas that a person can access, based on their role. For example, it is highly unlikely that someone from Human Resources should have access to a Server room. Only allowing certain people in specific areas not only reduces the risk of malicious activity but can also help find the person accountable as the list of potential suspects is much shorter.

### Monitoring Controls

- **CCTV:** 
	- Closed-circuit television allows monitoring from multiple interconnected cameras. This gives security teams expanded visibility.
- **Security Guards**: 
	- It’s all good to have these technical measures in place, but there needs to be a team that is trained in their use and maintenance so they can fully utilize the security controls and respond to incidents.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems**: 
	- These systems have several different triggers that can generate alerts or set off alarms, including thermal (heat) detection, sound detection, and movement detection. An example of this would be a sound detection system that can recognize the sound of glass smashing (such as an intruder breaking a window to gain access to the building) and trigger an alarm.

### Deterrents

- **Warning Signs:** 
	- Signs such as “DO NOT ENTER” and “You Are Trespassing” can be enough to make people turn around, as they have been informed that any further activity may be illegal.
- **Fences:** 
	- Chain-link metal fences are very common, with barbed or razor wire on top. This creates a barrier that can’t be climbed over and requires more effort for attackers to bypass, slowing them down, and giving more time for them to be detected.
- **Guard Dogs:** 
	- Security dogs that are trained to bark and cause distress are a strong deterrent. Despite being highly trained, they still appear to be dangerous in the eyes of the attacker. They are also able to help detain any intruders.
- **Security Lighting:** 
	- Lighting is used to prevent low visibility areas caused by darkness, which could allow an intruder to bypass security controls such as CCTV and Security Guards. Lighting the areas in conjunction with cameras is a great deterrent and monitoring solution.
- **CCTV Cameras:** 
	- If individuals believe they are being filmed (even if the cameras do not work) then this is likely to deter them from conducting any illegal or malicious activity, as there may be recorded evidence of them conducting a crime.
