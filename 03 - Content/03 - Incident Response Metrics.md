# [[03 - Incident Response Metrics]]  
---

Metrics play a crucial role in incident response as they provide quantitative assessment, enabling the measurement, comparison, and tracking of performance. By utilizing metrics, security teams can identify areas of strength and weakness, track trends in incidents, and support business decisions such as budget allocation and resource needs. The following are common incident response metrics that can be used for reporting purposes:

## Impact Metrics

1. **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: An agreement between an organization and its customer that defines expectations for factors like uptime, responsiveness, and responsibilities. SLAs are often expressed as percentages, with common values being 99% and 99.9%.
    
2. **Service Level Objective (SLO)**: An objective defined within the SLA, specifying a specific metric to measure, such as the uptime of a critical virtual machine. Failure to meet SLOs can hold both the organization and potentially the client accountable.
    
3. **Escalation Rate**: Measures the frequency at which alerts in a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system are correctly assigned to the appropriate security team member. This metric helps ensure that critical alerts are escalated to experienced analysts for proper handling.
    

## Time-Based Metrics

1. **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)** or **Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)**: The average time it takes for the security team to become aware that a security incident has occurred. Measuring MTTD is crucial for improving the effectiveness of alerting systems such as SIEMs.
    
2. **Mean Time to Response (MTTR)** or **Mean Time to Repair/Resolve/Recover**: The time interval from incident detection to when the security team takes action to address it. MTTR is an important metric that reflects the efficiency of incident response and helps identify areas for improvement.
    
3. **Incidents Over Time**: Measures the average number of incidents occurring over a specific period. This metric allows organizations to determine whether incident rates are increasing or decreasing and helps assess the effectiveness of security measures.
    
4. **Remediation Time**: Measures the time taken by incident responders and stakeholders to fully remediate the situation, including recovering affected systems and returning them to production status.
    

## Incident Type Metrics

1. **Cumulative Number of Incidents Per Type**: Categorizes incidents based on their type and compares the total number of incidents in each category. This metric provides an overview of areas that require improvement. For example, a high number of incidents caused by attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems would highlight the need for vulnerability management processes and mitigating controls.
    
2. **Alerts Created per Incident**: Analyzes the number of alerts generated for a specific incident. This metric helps identify gaps in defense mechanisms. For example, if an EDR system generates an alert for a malicious file download, but the organization's O365 environment fails to generate an alert, it indicates a potential area for improvement in the defense strategy.
    
3. **Cost per Incident (CPI)**: Analyzes the perceived cost of an incident to the affected company. It can be calculated by considering factors such as the duration of the incident multiplied by the cost of the security team, or by evaluating the impact of the incident on the business, such as loss of sales, productivity, or equipment. CPI is most useful when a business impact analysis (BIA) has been conducted to establish the baseline costs of the organization.
    

Remember that the choice of metrics may vary across organizations, but these examples provide a general understanding of the metrics used to evaluate incident response performance and support decision-making.
