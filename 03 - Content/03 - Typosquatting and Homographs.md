# [[03 - Typosquatting and Homographs]]

###### *A Visual based tactic that tricks the victim into thinking a web domain or email is legitimate.*

## Typo Squatting
- Typo squatting is the act of impersonating a brand or domain name by misspelling it, such as missing letters or including additional ones. Below are some examples of domains that are typo squatting the real SBT domain, securityblue.team.
	- **securltyblue.team**
	- **securitybllue.team**
	- **securtyblue.team**

## Homographs
- A homograph phishing attack is virtually impossible for users to spot. This attack exploits the fact that many different characters look exactly alike. These characters are called homographs, and the problem is with how the characters are encoded using Unicode.
- Wikipedia summarizes that “Unicode incorporates numerous writing systems, and, for a number of reasons, ==similar-looking characters such as Greek Ο, Latin O, and Cyrillic О were not assigned the same code. So, the Latin “o” and the Cyrillic “o” have a different Unicode and are therefore different letters.”== It also means domains with those two different Os are two different domains. Domains using non-Latin letters are referred to as internationalized domain names (IDN) and are used quite frequently in homograph attacks.

A great example of a homograph attack is the [article by BitDefender](https://labs.bitdefender.com/2019/08/new-homograph-phishing-attack-impersonates-bank-of-valletta-leverages-valid-tls-certificate/) titled "New Homograph Phishing Attack Impersonates Bank of Valletta". Another good resource is this [article by The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/2017/04/unicode-Punycode-phishing-attack.html) that talks about homograph attacks.
