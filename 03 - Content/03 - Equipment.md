Performing digital forensics investigations requires proper tools and equipment to ensure the integrity and security of the evidence. Here are some essential items that investigators should have in their toolkit:

## Forensic Laptop or Workstation
- A dedicated laptop or workstation specifically designated for digital evidence is crucial for gathering evidence at the scene or capturing evidence from memory.
- These systems often have specialized forensic software and Linux distributions such as CAINE or DEFT installed.

## Electro-Static Evidence Bags with Tamper-proof Stickers
- Electro-Static Evidence Bags are used to protect sensitive digital components from Electro-Static Discharge (ESD) during transportation.
- Tamper-proof stickers can be applied to these bags to maintain the chain of custody and prevent tampering.

## Labels
- Labels are essential for proper evidence collection and management.
- They help identify and track different pieces of hardware, making it easier for investigators and others in the chain of custody to identify the evidence.

## Photographs
- Digital cameras should be used to document the scene and the condition of IT equipment.
- Photographs can capture important details such as cable connections, external devices, screen content, and more.

## Grounding Bracelets
- Grounding bracelets are used to prevent electrostatic discharge from damaging or compromising evidence.
- Investigators should wear grounding bracelets when handling evidence to maintain its integrity.

## Hardware Write-Blockers
- Hardware write-blockers ensure read-only access to data storage devices, preventing any changes to the evidence.
- They can be software-based tools on the forensic laptop or dedicated hardware devices.

## Blank Hard Drives
- Having blank hard drives is essential for on-site data copying.
- These drives, used in conjunction with write-blockers, allow investigators to create bit-by-bit copies of suspect drives without altering the original evidence.

## Specialist Equipment
In certain cases, specialized equipment and software may be required for specific situations, such as:

- Wireless Stronghold/Faraday Boxes: These boxes block wireless signals, preventing remote access or data wiping.
- Specialized Write-Blockers: These write-blockers are designed for non-standard hard drives, cell phones, GPS devices, IoT devices, etc.
- Phone Jammers: Phone jammers block signals similar to faraday boxes or wireless strongholds.
- Dedicated Flash Drives: Flash drives containing specialized forensic tools like Encase, FTK, CSILinux, and MacQuisiton.

Having the appropriate equipment is essential for conducting effective and reliable digital forensics investigations. It ensures the proper handling, protection, and analysis of digital evidence, maintaining its integrity and admissibility in legal proceedings.
