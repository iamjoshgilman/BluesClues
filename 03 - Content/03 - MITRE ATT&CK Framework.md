## MITRE ATT&CK: Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge

**MITRE's Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK)** is a comprehensive knowledge base and model that provides insights into cyber adversary behavior. Introduced in 2013, ATT&CK has become a widely respected and referenced resource in the cybersecurity community. It offers a structured framework for understanding the different phases of an adversary's attack lifecycle and the specific platforms they target.

ATT&CK consists of three main components:

1. **Tactics**: High-level objectives that adversaries aim to achieve during an attack. Examples include initial access, execution, persistence, defense evasion, credential access, and impact.
2. **Techniques**: Specific methods and procedures used by adversaries to accomplish their tactics. There are over 250 documented techniques within ATT&CK, detailing the step-by-step actions an adversary might take to compromise a computer or network.
3. **Procedures**: Detailed descriptions of how adversaries execute their techniques, including specific tools, malware, and commands they employ.

ATT&CK serves as a valuable resource for identifying and understanding the behavior of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). It provides a standardized language and framework for security analysts to structure, compare, and analyze threat intelligence.

### ATT&CK for Threat Intelligence

ATT&CK offers analysts a common language and structure to analyze and compare threat intelligence. It helps in identifying the behavior of APTs and exploring the different ways they compromise systems and networks. 

To support threat intelligence analysis, MITRE provides various resources and materials, including:

- [Getting Started with ATT&CK: Threat Intelligence Blog Post](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/getting-started-with-attack-cti-4eb205be4b2f): This blog post describes how you can get started using ATT&CK for threat intelligence at three different levels of sophistication
- [ATT&CKing Your Adversaries Presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/JamieWilliams130/attcking-your-adversaries-operationalizing-cyber-intelligence-in-your-own-environment-for-better-sleep-and-a-safer-tomorrow): This presentation covers how to use ATT&CK to take cyber threat intelligence and operationalize it into behaviors that can drive relevant detections.
- [Blog posts on threat intelligence](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/using-att-ck-to-advance-cyber-threat-intelligence-part-2-6f21fdba80c): These blog posts explain the fundamentals of how to use ATT&CK for threat intelligence.
- [ATT&CKing the Status Quo Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7Hyd7d9k-c): This middle part of this presentation provides an introduction to using ATT&CK for threat intelligence.Â [Slides are also available](https://www.slideshare.net/KatieNickels/bsideslv-2018-katie-nickels-and-john-wunder-attcking-the-status-quo).
- [ATT&CKing with Threat Intelligence Presentation](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1yoKMVDjbrkGQ): This presentation provides a perspective on how to use threat intelligence for ATT&CK-based adversary emulation.Â [Slides are also available](https://www.slideshare.net/ChristopherKorban/attcking-with-threat-intelligence).
- [ATT&CK Navigator Use Case for Threat Intelligence](https://youtu.be/pcclNdwG8Vs): This demo provides an overview of the ATT&CK Navigator as well as a threat intelligence use case for how to compare group behaviors. A corresponding written tutorial on comparing Navigator layers isÂ [available here](https://attack.mitre.org/docs/Comparing_Layers_in_Navigator.pdf).

### ATT&CK vs. Kill Chain

While similar to the Cyber Kill Chain framework proposed by Lockheed Martin, ATT&CK differs in its approach. The Cyber Kill Chain defines a well-defined sequence of events in an attack, whereas ATT&CK focuses on the techniques employed in specific attack scenarios. 

The ATT&CK framework provides a detailed understanding of how attacks are performed, allowing security researchers to explore different attack methods and APT groups that utilize them. Many security professionals prefer ATT&CK over the Cyber Kill Chain due to its specificity, but some use a hybrid approach combining both frameworks for comprehensive threat identification and analysis.
