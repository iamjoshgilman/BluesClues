Incident response reports do not have a standardized format applicable to all security teams and organizations. However, it is common to find four main sections in an incident report:

## Executive Summary

- Provides a high-level overview of the incident using non-technical language.
- Focuses on the business impact, highlighting areas such as business risks, financial costs, and prevented damage.
- Emphasizes the value and effectiveness of the security team in mitigating the incident.
- Typically one page in length to ensure readability and relevance to executives.

## Incident Timeline

- Presents a chronological sequence of key events throughout the incident.
- Includes dates, times, and short descriptions of each event.
- Can be organized in the order actions were taken or discovered, or re-ordered to present events in chronological order.
- Timezone used can be the local timezone or Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) to maintain consistency and readability.

## Incident Investigation

- The main section of the report, providing a step-by-step account of actions taken and findings during the incident response.
- Covers all stages of the incident response lifecycle, excluding preparation:
    - Detection and Analysis: Describes how the incident was discovered, triaged, and analyzed. Includes screenshots or visual representations of investigative actions.
    - Containment, Eradication, and Recovery: Outlines how the incident was contained, the scope of impact, methods used to remove the threat actors, restoration from safe backups, antivirus scans, manual checks, and the identification of the root cause.
    - Post-Incident Activity: Reflects on improvements, recommendations, and lessons learned from the incident. Highlights areas where additional personnel, tools, or visibility may be needed for future incident response. Important points are included in the executive summary.

## Report Appendix

- Serves as storage for supporting materials referenced in the main body of the report.
- Includes images, figures, graphs, tables, or any other supplementary information.
- Helps maintain a concise and organized main report while providing additional details in a separate section.

Please note that report templates should be tailored to suit the specific needs and preferences of each organization. While the mentioned sections are commonly found in incident reports, the content and format may vary based on individual requirements and priorities.
