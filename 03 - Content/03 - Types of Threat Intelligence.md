# Strategic Threat Intelligence

This type of intelligence provides high-level, typically non-technical information that can be understood by anyone. It is used when presenting to executives and other decision-makers within an organization to aid with decisions such as budget spending and policy review or creation. Below are some examples of strategic intelligence pieces:

- A presentation that covers global events and links them with cyber activity (such as the Coronavirus pandemic resulting in an increase of tailored phishing attacks claiming to be from health authorities such as the World Health Organization).
- A report on patterns of cyber attacks that the organization is facing over a period of time (such as recognizing that the organization is receiving a more distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on Monday, and suggesting plans to mitigate this).
- Keeping the internal security team informed about activity related to threat actors that target organizations operating in the same industries (such as the threat intelligence team in a bank monitoring for attacks against other banks, and updating their internal team so they are aware and can prepare for attacks).

Strategic intelligence specialists can be very geographically-focused, understanding the political situation and motives of a country.

# Operational Threat Intelligence

Operational intelligence is all about studying threat actors that might target the organization, in order to gain information about who they are, their motivations, and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used to conduct campaigns or prolonged cyber operations.

- This can help to build more effective defenses by actively monitoring techniques that are used by adversaries, and understanding the actor(s) at a deeper level. 
- This work, which is typically technical, is not easily automated and requires human analysts to track and research malicious groups.

# Tactical Threat Intelligence

Tactical intelligence is technical in nature and is of immediate value to an organization. It is typically shared in the form of indicators of compromise (IOCs), which are known malicious artifacts such as URLs, domains, email addresses, file hashes, IP addresses, and more. These can either be used by human analysts to check for exposure or can be ingested by security tools via APIs or threat feeds. Below are some examples of tactical intelligence pieces:

- A list of email addresses (IOCs) that are being used to send phishing emails containing the Emotet malware is given to an analyst, and they manually check the email gateway security tool to identify any incoming emails from these addresses.
- A threat feed that can be subscribed to, which includes a constantly updated list of malicious IPs, is primarily intended to feed into network intrusion prevention systems, so they can autonomously block bad IPs.
- A public report from a threat intelligence company that includes a number of IOCs gathered by monitoring exploitation activity targeting a new zero-day vulnerability.
