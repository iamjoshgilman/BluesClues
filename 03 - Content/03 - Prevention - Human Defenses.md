## Security Awareness Training

- Security awareness training should be provided to employees during onboarding and made mandatory.
- Training topics may include identifying phishing emails, understanding security policies, and best practices for social media usage related to work.
- Regularly refreshing employees' knowledge through annual training sessions helps maintain security awareness.

## Security Policies

- Security policies establish rules for employees regarding the use of company equipment, network connectivity, and social media posts related to work.
- Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) are commonly used to define acceptable and prohibited actions.
- Examples of AUP rules may include restrictions on visiting certain websites, downloading unauthorized applications, and sharing login credentials.
- AUPs should clearly state the consequences of policy violations.

## Incentives

- Some organizations have internal programs that recognize "security champions" who demonstrate exceptional security awareness and contribute to identifying potential risks.
- Recognition and gratitude, rather than monetary rewards, can serve as effective incentives for promoting security-conscious behavior.
- Gift cards or vouchers are cost-effective alternatives for providing incentives.

## Phishing Simulations

- Regular phishing simulations should be conducted to test the effectiveness of the security awareness program.
- Harmless phishing emails can be sent to employees, and metrics such as reporting rates, click rates, and repeat offenders can be measured.
- Different departments can be targeted with specialized phishing emails, and occasional simulations should also target the C-suite.

## Whistleblowing

- Organizations should provide anonymous channels for employees to report suspicious or malicious behavior observed in their colleagues.
- Anonymous reporting encourages employees to come forward without fear of retaliation.
- Whistleblowing helps identify potential insider threats and allows security teams to intervene before significant damage occurs.

#### Remember these key points:
- Security awareness training is essential for employees and should cover topics such as phishing, security policies, and social media usage.
- Security policies, including Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), define acceptable and prohibited actions for employees.
- Recognizing "security champions" and providing incentives can encourage employees to maintain security-conscious behavior.
- Conducting regular phishing simulations helps assess the effectiveness of security awareness programs and identify areas for improvement.
- Whistleblowing channels enable anonymous reporting of suspicious or malicious behavior, contributing to early detection and prevention of insider threats.
