- Incident response teams play a crucial role in handling security incidents effectively.
- This section covers the importance of dedicated teams, the composition of these teams, and their operational procedures.

## Why do we Need Incident Response Teams?
- A dedicated incident response team is essential for responding to confirmed incidents promptly and minimizing their impact on the business.
- These specialist teams work to ensure business continuity and reduce costs resulting from successful attacks.
- By bringing together individuals with the necessary skills, the incident response team can be activated quickly, minimizing the time for potential damage.
- Larger organizations often maintain a full-time staff dedicated to preparation, testing, and incident response, while smaller organizations may have team members with other roles who can step up when incidents occur.

## Incident Response Team Members
- Incident response teams consist of skilled individuals from various departments, not limited to security analysts.

### Incident Commander
- The Incident Commander, typically a dedicated Incident Response Manager, is responsible for managing the incident.
- They coordinate response efforts and maintain communication among all relevant parties.
- The Incident Commander serves as the point of contact for all departments and provides periodic updates to management and the C-suite.

### Security Analysts
- Security Analysts with a deep technical understanding of networks and expertise in triaging and investigating security alerts are crucial team members.
- They perform firsthand analysis of incidents, collect information about affected systems, the time of the incident, and specific activity observed.

### Forensic Analysts
- Forensic Analysts possess advanced technical skills in digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).
- They conduct in-depth investigations, retrieve and preserve digital evidence, and prepare it for potential legal prosecution.

### Threat Intelligence Analysts
- Threat Intelligence Analysts provide context to incidents by identifying threat actors, conducting exposure checks using indicators of compromise (IOCs) and artifacts, and sharing intelligence with other organizations.

### Management/C-Suite
- Inclusion of management board members such as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Operations Officer (COO), and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) ensures the availability of necessary resources for incident prevention and response.

### Human Resources (HR)
- HR department members play a role in coordinating the organization's response when an employee is involved in an incident, which may include legal action, termination, or warnings.

### Public Relations
- The PR department handles communication when incidents affect the public, employees, or customers (e.g., data breaches).
- They announce incidents, determine information to be shared, identify notification recipients, and communicate with stakeholders.

### Legal
- Legal department members provide legal advice, support forensic analysts, HR, and PR, ensuring compliance with the law.
- They ensure legal obligations are met, such as notifying affected individuals and ensuring the forensic integrity of digital evidence.

Note: The composition of an incident response team may vary depending on the organization's size and specific requirements.

## Conclusion
- Incident response teams are vital for effectively handling security incidents.
- These teams bring together individuals with diverse skills and expertise.
- Collaboration among team members from different departments ensures a comprehensive and coordinated response.
- Having dedicated incident response teams improves incident management, minimizes impact, and ensures compliance with legal requirements.
