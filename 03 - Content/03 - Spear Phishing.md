Spear phishing is when a malicious actor spends time before the phishing attack to gather information about their specific target, to make the email more effective. 
- By tailoring the email to the target, it makes it more convincing. It increases the chances of the recipient clicking on the email and entering their credentials, or opening an attachment. 
- This type of attack requires planning and good use of open-source intelligence (OSINT) sources to gather information. 
	- The attacker will look for websites that the target uses, any hobbies or interests they have, and even record family members, colleagues, or friends. 
	- All of this information can be used to create highly effective emails that seem legitimate.

Other phishing email techniques can be used, such as typosquatting or sender spoofing, to make the email sender appear legitimate, and if the attacker is trying to entice the target to visit a malicious website, the typo squat domain works to mimic the real name of a legitimate site, making it harder to spot at a glance that it's fake.
