Whaling is a highly-targeted phishing attack that looks to target individuals within management positions in an organization, often C-level executives, due to the wealth of information they have access to, and that stereotypically they are not highly educated around cybersecurity and phishing. Targets often include:

- **Chief Operations Officer (COO)**
- **Chief Executive Officer (CEO)**
- **Chief Finance Officer (CFO)**

These emails will be refined typically using information gained from open-source intelligence sources, making them more believable for the intended target, and increasing the chance they will interact with it. Attacks could attempt to entice the target to download a file that will download malware to the system, try to extract their credentials by sending them a link to a credential harvester, or simply work to extract private or confidential information from the individual using social engineering tactics.
