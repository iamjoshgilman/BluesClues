## IOC (Indicator of Compromise):
Intelligence gathered from malicious activity, intrusions, or incidents. An example would be a piece of malware observed in an attack against an organization. File hashes and file names can be shared with other organizations so they can add them to blocklists or perform threat exposure checks.

## TTP (Tools, Techniques, and Procedures):
MITRE has defined over 240 unique tactics used by adversaries, known as TTPs. You can find them [here](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/), each with detailed descriptions and the threat actors known to use them.

## PCAP (Packet Capture):
A file that contains stored information of network traffic captured by a network monitoring tool, such as Wireshark. PCAP files can be imported into tools for network analysis purposes, such as Wireshark or TCPDump.

## HDD (Hard Disk Drive):
A hard disk drive is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses one or more rotating platters coated with magnetic material, allowing data to be written to and read from the device.

## SSD (Solid State Disk Drive):
An SSD is a solid-state storage device that uses circuit assemblies to store data persistently, typically using flash memory, as opposed to the spinning magnetic disks used by hard disk drives.

## USB Drive (Universal Serial Bus Drive):
A portable small-scale storage device that includes flash memory. USB drives are typically used to transport files from one system to another without requiring network connectivity.

## ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers):
ACPO provides a set of guidelines for computer-based evidence, containing four main principles. These guidelines help guide law enforcement and digital forensic experts when conducting investigations to ensure that the evidence is valid and can be submitted in court for legal proceedings.

## KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor):
KAPE is used for fast acquisition of digital evidence and files that may be of interest to a forensic examiner. The operator can define the information they want to collect using modules, and KAPE will retrieve important information within minutes, while a complete forensic copy could take hours.

## FTK Imager (Forensic Tool Kit Imager):
A free tool that allows for the creation of bit-by-bit disk drive images, mounting disk images in read-only mode (software write-blocker), and analysis functionality to analyze disk images.

## Write-Blocker:
A software or hardware device that prevents one system from writing to another, ensuring that digital evidence isn't unintentionally tampered with. Write-blockers are typically used between a hard drive that may contain digital evidence and a forensic laptop or workstation that is taking a forensic copy of the data.

## BHC (Browser History Capturer):
A free tool that allows the operator to collect core files from mainstream web browsers, which can be manually reviewed or imported into Browser History Viewer for analysis of web history.

## BHV (Browser History Viewer):
A free tool that allows the operator to capture some core browser files (it is better to use Browser History Capturer to collect files for analysis) and provides analysis functionality, allowing for the inspection of long-term browser history, cached images, and web pages.

## /etc/passwd (Linux Passwd File):
The passwd file, located at /etc/passwd, contains information about all the user accounts on a Linux system, including accounts used by service daemons and user-created accounts. This file can be combined with the associated shadow file to allow cracking of user passwords.

## /etc/shadow (Linux Shadow File):
The shadow file, located at /etc/shadow, contains the encrypted passwords for all accounts on a Linux system. This file can be combined with the associated passwd file to allow cracking of

 user passwords.
